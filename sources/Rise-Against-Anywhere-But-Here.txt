Rise Against
Anywhere But Here

We've been alright up to now,
But the air that we breath is about to run out.
We've rehearsed our lines clear and loud,
But the cue never came and the lights,
They never went out.
So we're passing the time, 
While time passes us.
The fast lanes a term never applied to us.
Without a dime to my name,
Or a prayer in the world.
I walk out the door.
Destination anywhere but here.
Away from you.
Now I'm on my way to the other side,
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind.
(On my way)
These empty rooms,
(On my way)
Are still filled with you.
(On my way)
So I dropped out of my own race,
A race with no finish line,
No first or last place.
I watch these faces all run right past me.
I turn and walk away,
'Cause we finally know now what our
Time here's about, we were not meant to be
Another face in the crowd.
We're a forest of lives,
We grow tall and wide. 
We won't ever be cut down.
Now I'm on my way to the other side,
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind.
(On my way)
These empty rooms,
(On my way)
Are still filled with you.
(On my way)
I'm so tired and turned around and scared.
I'm lying in empty beds again.
I'll wait for you to come
To your senses, barbed-wire fences
Won't keep me from breaking through.
I swear I will for you.
Now I'm on my way to the other side,
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind.
(On my way)
These empty rooms,
(On my way)
Are still filled with you.
(On my way)
I'm so tired and turned around and scared.
I'm lying in empty beds again.
Away from you.
