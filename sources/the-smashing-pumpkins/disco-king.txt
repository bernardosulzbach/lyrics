The Smashing Pumpkins
Disco King

the disco nights are over now
sittin' tight in the fallout
was it love or chemical?
fascination or oh so dreadful?
you run, you run, you run so slow
you run, you run alone
you know i'm not dead
'cause i'm living in my head
'cause i am waiting in the ways of desire
you always find a way
and through the fall, into us all you move
forgotten touch
forbidden thought
we never, ever have enough
you know i'm not dead
you know i'm not dead
i'm just livin' in my head
you know i'm not dead
the disco nights are over now
sittin' hollow in the fallout
was it love or was it chemical?
fascination or oh so dreadful?
you run, you run, you run so slow
you run, you run alone
you know i'm not dead
i'm just living in my head
'cause i am waiting in the ways of desire
you always find a way
and through the fall, into us all you move
forgotten touch
forbidden thought
we can never have enough
in the ways of desire
you always find a way
and through the fall, into us all you move
forgotten touch
forbidden thought
we can never have enough
you know i'm not dead
you know i'm not dead
