Spiteface

Your words will one day spite your face
And another mouth will come and take its place
It'll speak and speak and speak and sputter me dry
I will never understand the motive drive
Muck
You
Up
Muck
In a dream I wander on
To the bell tower, writing songs
So I crumple this page, and rip it up
Never piece my broken heart to you
Muck
You
Up
Muck
Your words will one day spite your face
And another mouth will come and take its place
It'll speak and speak and speak and sputter me dry
I will never understand the motive drive
Muck
Your words will spite your face
Your words will spite your face
Spiteface
