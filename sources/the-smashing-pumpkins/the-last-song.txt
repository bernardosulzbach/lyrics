The Last Song

This is the last song
This is the last song I'll sing for you
This is the last song
This is the last song I can give you
The roaring city sleeps
Metal fingers clutching dirty sheets
And no one comes for free
In this place where the angels sleep
This is the last song
My eyes are open
My eyes are open wonder to this
As you hold the secrets
I count the minutes off so perfectly
The shards of broken glass
Sing the strains of a sad old tune
We've made it at last
But what we had is lost inside our past
This is the last song
Could you find away across me
To forgive and forget me
To appease and relent me
To deceive and detect me
To understand and release me
To the dawn
This is the last song
