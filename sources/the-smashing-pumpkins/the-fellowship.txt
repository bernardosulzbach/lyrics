The Smashing Pumpkins
The Fellowship

Get on board, this train ain't going to stop.
Where it's going, I don't know. You know, you know, you know.
Wheels on fire, fields of decent desire.
Punch your ticket, it's time to go
There's a force around the bend, that drives this engine.
Are you with us? Are you with us?
Are you with us, or against us tonight? It's alright
Doesn't matter of where we meet this night. It's alright
Are you with us tonight? It's alright, it's alright, it's alright!
Are you with us tonight?
It's time to fly. We're on this eerie ride.
A steel horse, tied to dirt. No words, no words, for worst.
For once we'll survive, against this sacrifice.
For what is love, if not cause?
Ruby's wheels are falling off. Take them prayers and run
Are you with us? Are you with us?
Are you with us, or against us?
Are you with us, or against us?
Are you with us, or against us tonight? It's alright
Doesn't matter of where we meet this night. It's alright
Are you with us tonight? It's alright, it's alright, it's alright!
Are you with us tonight?
Are you with us tonight?
Are you with us, or against us?
Are you with us, or against us?
Are you with us, or against us?
Are you with us, or against us?
