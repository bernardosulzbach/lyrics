Try to Try

I walk a real thin line
They say I just don't care
That I'm a motherfucker, I don't care
I am what I am
I am what you make me
And I'll fuck with you as you fuck with me
Try, try, try
Just try to try
Try, try
Try, I'll try
Try, I'll try
Try, I'll try
'Cause when I die...
Try, try, try
Just fucking try, try, try
Just try to try, try
Try, try
