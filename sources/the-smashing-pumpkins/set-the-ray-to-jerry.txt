The Smashing Pumpkins
Set the Ray to Jerry

Born to please every simple need
I stand alone in my thoughts indeed
Hate you for ever making me
I'm in you, I'm your anything
I want you and I need you
All you are is brand new
And I need you
Come to me, let me hold you still
I'm so tired, just as tired as you
Take me for anyone but me
All that you feel is never true
I want you and I need you
All you are is brand new
And I need you
When you say that you are
Forever, my star
Could never every let you go
And never let you know
Let roar these fears 
To the whore of my tears
Pure as a lie
I pour to your eyes
Suck you like the sap from a tree
Honey from the dew
From the bumble bees
I want you and I need you
All you are is brand new
And I need you
When you say that you are
Forever, my star
I'll never let go
Never let you know
