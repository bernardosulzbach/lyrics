Razor

Razor in my hand
Nine little lines in someone's hand
Shot down from this group
I wish for something and I know it isn't home
Razor in my hand
Six little lines in someone's hand
Lay down, rest your head
You reach for something, and you feel something sting
Razor, razor, razor, razor
Want it
Now you rip apart who you are
Deliver
Yeah, you deliver who you are
Oh, razor
My little razor
Oh, razor
I wanna go
I wanna go
I'm like a junkie, I want it all
I wanna go
Want it
Now you rip apart who you are
Deliver
Yeah, you deliver who you are
Oh, razor
My little razor
My little razor
I wanna go
I wanna go
I'm like a junkie, I want it all
I wanna go
