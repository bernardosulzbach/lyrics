right off the silver screen
into a moonbeam
to the Indian sun
Catch up with Jesus
the stars beneath us
oh what a beautiful night
cool in your pocket
you can unlock this night
cool in your pocket
you can unlock it
you can't stop this night
it's alright
oh what a beautiful sight
you are to me
oh what a beautiful night
cool in your pocket
rocks for your rocket ride
cool in your pocket
you can unlock this
you can't help but decide
it's alright
oh what a beautiful night
start up the revelry
roll out the cavalry
into the waters we dive
shimmers on the cosmos
ripple the uppermost
of the quivering tide
locks for your locket
you can unlock its fist
rocks for your rocket
you can unlock it
cracks for your socket eyes
that shine
oh what a beautiful sight
you are to me
oh what a beautiful night
oh what a beautiful sight
you are to me
oh what a beautiful night
night, night
oh what a beautiful night
