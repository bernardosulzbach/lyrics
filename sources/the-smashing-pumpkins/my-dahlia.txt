My Dahlia

To taste my fear
Summon up your demons, dear
I left you open
Wondering
When you lie to break my heart
My Dahlia
My Dahlia, dear
My Dahlia
My Dahlia, dear
I breathe in shame
Blew it in the choices made
My words, my summons
Say I dare
When you lie to break my heart
When you lie, I'll break, I'll break to break
My Dahlia
My Dahlia, dear
My Dahlia
My Dahlia, dear
Anyone can see
You're laughing down at me
It's easy for you now
No room for me
Queens are what we gather here
I left you open
Wondering
When you lie to break my heart
When you lie, I'll break, I'll break to break
My Dahlia
My Dahlia, dear
My Dahlia
My Dahlia, dear
Anyone can see
You're laughing down at me
It's easy for you now
