The Smashing Pumpkins
Pale Horse

If I was 
I'd turn back
Give up all my reasons
Forget the past
You think I'd swallow 
Bearing the weight of the ceilings
Just to stop and [ask?]
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
They give you this
They take away that
Fluorescein
They'll be no rallies
They'll be no long last 
Empty on the inside
Running out of the last protests
Standing by the feeling of an end
[stowaway or slow away?] [lights or life?]
Runaway [love or life?]
When they lit you up
You shut me out
They gave me the keys so I could show you around
But we were not around
Ominous of a day dream of a cottage [abound?]
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
They give you this
They take away that
Fluorescein
They'll be no rallies
They'll be no long last ...
Coming [or cutting?] out of the spotlight
Running out of the last protests
Standing by the feelings of an end
[stowaway or slow away?] [lights or life?]
Runaway [love or life?]
