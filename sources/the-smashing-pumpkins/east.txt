East

tried to tell her who i really am
but I'm not so sure that i really can
well, you've got to know, i don't understand
well, you've got to know who i really am
give me one more chance
as a child, i once had a dream
my mother spoke something down to me
she said, "son, you must walk upon your knees
down the road, headed for the east"
give me one more chance
give me one more chance
if i had a way to go, i'd gather up my throwing stone
tried to tell her who i really am
but i'm not so sure that i really can
well, you've got to know i don't understand
'cause i'm not so sure who i really am
if i had a way to go, i'd gather up my throwing stone
if i had a way to go, i'd gather up my throwing stone
