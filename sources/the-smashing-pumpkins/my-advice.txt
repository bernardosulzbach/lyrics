My Advice

Another day that passes just seems like a laugh
And we had months and days, can we talk is it okay
And we’re still on top of this world we made
And if we’re still on top why do you stare that way
And now I understand how every part of a man dies
And there’s just one thing left 
And that’s a heart that needs mending
And we’re still on top of this world we made
And if we’re still on top
And if you slip away
My advice to you is stay with me 
And I’m telling you
My advice, yes my advice
Is stay with me, for a little while
And talk with me, can we reconcile
Stay with me tonight
My advice to you is stay with me 
No I’m telling you
My advice, which you never listen to
Is stay with me for a little while
And talk with me, if I’m in denial
And stay with me tonight, tonight.
