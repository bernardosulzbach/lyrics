Bye June

Bye June 
I'm going to the moon 
It better be by June 
'Cause I'm going to the moon 
So June 
You'd better make it soon 
I hope you make it June 
'Cause I'm going to the moon 
Bye June 
Bye June 
I'm going to the moon 
I hope you make it soon 
'Cause I'm waiting on this moon 
Bye June 
I hope you make it too 
I'm wishing you're there too 
I hope you make it June 
Bye bye June
