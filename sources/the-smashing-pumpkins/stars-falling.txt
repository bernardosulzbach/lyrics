Stars Falling

I know this room just crumbled like a tomb
Surrender to the day that I made
Stars falling
Stars falling
You'll waste it
You're not simple
When my head swells just like a balloon
So soon I must realize
One by one we're dangerous
Now lead us to blasphemy
Stars falling
I want to touch your soul complete
Higher than I ever want to be
I'm in love with you
Over the edge and over to the show
Proud of the show and the neon lights
What I've done has brought me home
Look at me, who would have known?
Stars falling
Stars falling
Stars falling
[ok]
