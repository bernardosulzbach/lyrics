Waiting for You Now

Waiting for you now 
Waiting for you now
Somehow, somehow 
Did you ever wake up and call 
Wishing I was around 
Why don't you stop on by sometime? 
Stop on by sometime 
Sometimes you feel you're not so young 
Sometimes you feel you're growing old 
Come on home, come on home 
Waiting for you now 
Waiting for you now
You now, you now 
Did you ever wake up? 
And wish you were someone else 
I know this feeling 
I know what want, I know what want
Down to the core 
Sometimes 
We are one inside a shell 
Sometime 
You know I feel it sometimes 
When you're blind 
Waiting for you to call 
Waiting for you now
You now, you now
