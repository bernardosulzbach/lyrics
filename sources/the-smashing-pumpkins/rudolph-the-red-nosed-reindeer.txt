Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

Anything we should know about your change? 
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You could even say it glowed
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Now all the others love him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
You'll go down in history
You'll go down in history
