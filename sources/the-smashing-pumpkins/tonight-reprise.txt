The Smashing Pumpkins
Tonight Reprise

And the embers never fade in my city by the lake
The place where i was born
As the wind-up toys wind down
Muffling the sound of a life hidden underground
Believe, believe in me, believe
That you can change, that you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same we're different tonite
We'll crucify the insincere tonite
We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonite
The impossible is possible tonite
Believe in me like i believe in you tonite
