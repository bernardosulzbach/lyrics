Jesus Loves His Babies

Jesus loves his babies
Outside in the sunshine
I don't mind, no
I don't mind
Jesus loves his babies
Even when they're out of line
I don't mind, no
I don't mind
I'm fine
Jesus loves his crazies
Keeping pennies with the line
I don't mind, no
I don't mind
Jesus loves his babies
Outside in the sunshine
Sunshine over here
*Phone ringing*
Billy [Spoken]: Hi this is Billy, I'm not home right now, but leave your name and number and I'll get back to you. *beep*
Jimmy [Spoken, pitch-shifted down, as Jesus Christ]: Billy, Billy, pick up the phone, I know you're home. It's Jesus. I'm very angry with you. I'm going to punish you, Billy! Hahahaha! I'm going to punish you, Billy! Can you hear me Billy? Are you listening? I hope you're listening Bil-ly!
