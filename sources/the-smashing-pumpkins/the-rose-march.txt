Slowpoked
And cross-eyed
Pigeon-toed to the railroad ties
Humpbacked
And sugar shacked
Shotgun wed to
The poison of our past
A little longer
A little longer to go
You've a little longer
A little longer to go
I just can't help say so
Can't you see me
Can't you see me at all
Inner-spaced
And pie-faced
You catch the moon
I'll just stand here and run in place
Shell-shocked
And half-cocked
The universe is full of black holes, and anniversary knots
A little longer to go
You've a little longer
A little longer to go
You've a little longer to go
Can't you see me at all
Can't you see me
Can't you see me at all
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
Can't you see me at all
I'll lay roses at your feet
Till you decide there is something great in you
I'll lay roses at your feet
Till you decide there is something great in you

We've only just begun to grieve the space
We've only just begun to grieve the space, the space
We've only just begun to grieve the space, the space
