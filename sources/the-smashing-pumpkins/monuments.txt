I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright
Love can dust ya easy, as you know
And doubts make you feel slow
When shades of reason in you gone
I know, I know you'll go
Luva, you're strange
Luva, you're strange to me
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright
Vest was in the eagle of your soul
Where's Kelly as you sung
Don't ever feel that unknown
Behold, it take home
Luva, you're strange
Luva, you're strange to me
And what do ya want me to do?
It's all gone bad
What do ya want me to say?
I'm lost like you
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright
