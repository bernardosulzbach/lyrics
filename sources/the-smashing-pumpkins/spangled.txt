Spangled

How I love you
Isn't fair
God must want me
Next to you there
And if I show up
To disappear
Will you find me
Half as near?
Tangled in your body
Spangled by the night time stars
Of all the lovers
To be a friend
I'll come back when
You know me
And it's a sad state
Of happiness
If I confess
To my loneliness
Tangled in your body
Spangled by the night time stars
Tangled in your body
Spangled by the night time stars
How I've loved you so
It's how I've loved you so
Butterflies don't fly
Broken hearts don't cry no no
How I've loved your body, baby
How I've loved your sapphires and rubies
Butterflies don't make it in movies
How I've loved you so
God I love you so
God I love you so
