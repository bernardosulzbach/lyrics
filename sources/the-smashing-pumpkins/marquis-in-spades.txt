The Smashing Pumpkins
Marquis in Spades

And I'd love you to notice
I'm devoted
To destroy for no one
Now it's that time again to take revenge
On all the debutantes and their friends
The bitter charlemagnes so self-absorbed
The bodily remains such a bore
Hey, yeah
Was I good enough to break you
Hey, yeah
And all I see is empty
'Cause now I'm one of them
So adored
The slink of impotence
That money can afford
We know who you are and where you live
Is your innocence all that you can give
Hey, yeah
Was I good enough to break you
Hey, yeah
In the back of the car
The angel dust was given back to the stars
Hey, yeah
Was I good enough to break you
Hey, yeah
And in this fall from grace
We'll meet again
Another time another place
I've been down deep in you and me
Let's see where we can go
Yeah yeah yeah
Angels, Barbe
