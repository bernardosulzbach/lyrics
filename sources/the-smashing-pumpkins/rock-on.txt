Rock On

hey kids, rock and roll
rock on
hey kids, it's no use
Sleepin'
Showtime, summertime blues
Jump up and die in your blue suede shoes
Hey kids, rock and roll
We're gonna rock on
Where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear
Still looking for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl i've ever seen
See her die on my movie screens
Every day
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on
Hey kids, rock and roll
Rock on
Cool my soul
Hey kids it's no use
Dreamin'
Lost out, cracked out
Find out what it's all about
Hey kids, rock and roll
We're gonna rock on
Where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear
Where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear
Still lookin' for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her die on my movie screens
every day
