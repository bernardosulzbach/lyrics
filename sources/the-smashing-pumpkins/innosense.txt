Innosense

Innocence, innocence finds you there
Innocence, innocence doesn't care
Any way you choose
The sun, are the son
Are true
Hold me now I won't let go
Innocence, innocence let's you go
Innocence, innocence holds you down
Anyway, Anyway that you want
And you will be there
With the sun and you say you don't care
Anyway, Anyway that you want
In the love, in the love we're unsung
It's anyway, anyway that you want
Hold it in, innocence in your arms
Innocence, innocence holds you there
Innocence, innocence doesn't care
Innocence, innocence lets you dream
Innocence
