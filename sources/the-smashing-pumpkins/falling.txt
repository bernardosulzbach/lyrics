Falling

I have no other life 
And I gave fast into you
Wonder where you are now 
And why don't you care 
And I always think of
All the things that you've seen now
If you see me falling
Will you lend a hand
If you hear me calling
Will you understand
If you see me falling
Will you lend a hand
If you hear me calling
I'll understand
Ooh, I've waited my whole life for you 
All the things you do are true
I've tried so hard
And all I give was
All I see is you and me
I've tried so hard
And all I have dear is
If you see me falling
Will you lend a hand
And if you hear me calling
I'm just so lost without you
Soon now
Wait for
The whole world
Will be there with you darling
If you see me falling
Will you lend a hand
If you hear me calling
Will you understand
If you see me falling
Will you lend a hand
If you hear me calling
Will you understand
