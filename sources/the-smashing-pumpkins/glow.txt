The Smashing Pumpkins
G.L.O.W

I'm so lone, I'm so lone, I'm thinking
I'm so lone, I can't get old
I'm so lone, I'm so lone, I can't get it off of you
Would you love yourself
Would you love yourself and no-one else
Buried in yourself
Come on baby, drive me crazy
One last trip to hell 
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it? 
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it glowing you? slowing you?
Is it glowing you?
I'm so lone, I'm so lone, I'm sinking
I'm so lone, I can't get lost in you
For you love yourself
For you love yourself and no-one else
Buried in yourself
Come on baby, no time for maybes
One last trip to hell
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it? 
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it glowing you? slowing you?
Is it glowing you?
It's not strange 
You are the same of me 
It's not strange
That I'm so strange
To please
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it?
Come on, come on, come on,
Can you feel it glow?
