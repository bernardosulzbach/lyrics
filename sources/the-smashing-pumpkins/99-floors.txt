I used to know you 
I used to care 
I used to know you 
Are you still there? 
I won't touch you 
I won't feel you 
I won't hear you 
I won't see you 
I used to know you 
Are you still there? 
I used to know you 
I used to care 
It goes far and wide 
It's a cruel device 
I cannot drive 
You from my mind 
I won't reach out 
I won't strike in 
I won't dream about 
I won't parse the thought 
I used to know you 
I used to care 
I used to know you 
Are you still there? 
I jumped from the top 
And fell right back and I 
Hit the ground running 
Scared 
I swam to the bottom of the sea 
And I asked around for someone 
Who might know me 
Ain't a sad when your choices 
are Vegas and your friends 
99 floors 
And still nowhere to go 
99 floors 
And still nowhere to roam
A punch to the head 
I passed right out and an
impotent stood dumbstruck 
and stared
Armed once again by the fist of fate 
I wait for his resurrection home 
Ain't it sad when your choices 
are vices or advice 
It's eleven o'clock 
And don't that make you bawl 
It's eleven o'clock 
And don't ya make it bawl 
Evil, ailing 
Feeling oh so low 
I'm slow to anger 
Wonder where I could 
Ever go 
You know I'd have to forget 
It goes far and wide 
It's a cruel device 
I cannot drive 
You from my mind
