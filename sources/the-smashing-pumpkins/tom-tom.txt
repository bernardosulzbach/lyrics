Farther down along the range
Where the wise ones kept at bay
Those that wish secrets stay secret, for morning mass
I tell myself, 
It's where I belong
Among the waves and the dead and gone
With my ancestors drums
Here comes the morning man
He's gonna tell you where you stand
Gonna try to undertake what's falling, he's calling you
Here comes the morning man
He's here and yes he can
Penetrate the veils that you're holding, unfolding you
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la 
This sign of a solstice bare
Where autumn shows its truthful air
Is when I'm vowed to empty scare 
The precious stars of morning prayers
I tell myself it's who you are
An orphan soul on a distant star
Listening for those bells
Here comes the morning man
He's here and yes he can
Penetrate the veils that you're holding, unfolding you
Here comes the morning man
He's gonna tell you where you stand
Gonna try to undertake what's falling, he's calling you
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Here comes the morning man
Sha-la-la-la
Here comes the morning man
He's watching, unfolding you
Here comes the morning man
He's watching, watching you
