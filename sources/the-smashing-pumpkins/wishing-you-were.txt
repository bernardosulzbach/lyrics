Wishing You Were

wishing you were real
so i could wish you mine
wishing you were real
i cling to all that is divine
my woman lies with the dewdrops
my courage with the stars
wishing you were real
so i could spy you from afar
aimed at her myths of horseflies
and spider eyes
spun to her gilded webs of hope
and mercy crimes
wishing you were real
so i could wish you mine
wishing you were real
i cling to all that is divine
wishing you were real
wishing you were real
we'll take our secrets to the grave
safely held beneath the thoughts
the secrets will be lost
while i'm forever not yours
i'm wishing you were real
my face is blistered true
wishing you were real
so that i could always wish for you
wishing you were real
wishing you were real
wishing you were real
wishing you were real
wishing you were real
