I Need You Around

the sun has blessed, the rays are gone 
and all the kids have left their tears and gone home 
sweet 17, sour 29 
and i can't explain myself what i hope to find 
you're all so kind without her here 
baby i need you around 
baby i need you around 
maybe i need you 
maybe i need you all right now 
baby i need you around 
i had no luck 
i had no shame 
i had no cause, just 17 days of rain 
and you in my eyes 
just one more song to slay this earth 
and i can't explain myself just what it's worth 
it's all i had, but not all i need 
and i can't escape the fact that i still bleed 
it's all too steep without her here 
baby i need you around 
baby i need you around 
baby i need you around 
i had no voice 
i had no drive 
i had no choice 
i had no crime 
i had myself 
i had my band 
i had my love 
i had no hand in watching it all fall apart 
baby i need you around 
baby i need you around 
maybe i need you 
maybe i need you all right now 
baby you need me around
