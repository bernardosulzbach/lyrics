Bury Me

[Over you, like an angel]
Bury me in love
Bury me in blood
Shield your kisses
Take your heart
Bury me if it hurts
I love my sister so [chain, unchain]
She don't smother me [chain, unchain, unchain]
I'm breathe in spades I know [unchain]
I'm a jack of all trades
Won't you bury me?
Want to see her born inside [hide, hide]
Some are things you just can't hide
If you see her tell me why [hide, hide]
Why won't she come outside?
If you see her tell me why [hide, hide]
Why won't she come outside?
Want to see her born inside [hide, hide]
Some of the things you just can't hide
She waits, bury me
She waits, bury me
