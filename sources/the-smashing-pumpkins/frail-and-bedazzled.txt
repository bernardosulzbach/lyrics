Frail and Bedazzled

So, now listen here
I wanna be, ohh so clear
I lost my soul, lost I'll stay
Between your hands, and my beliefs 
And here I am
Frail
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare 
Tug, at my sleeve
My little girl, supermaid
She don't know, that I have
Stole my smile, from a cheshire cat 
And all I wanted
Was to be a man
And since I gave up
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free 
Two of us that's dangerous
It's all inside our heads
Givin' in for nothin' less
Leavin' me for him 
Try
To understand
The ones I love
And their demands
It's so unfair
When they can't see
That I'm the boy
Who really needs 
Their love
I suppose 
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare
