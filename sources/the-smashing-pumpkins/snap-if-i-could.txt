Snap (If I Could)

I'll break someone, somewhere
To show how big I am
You know I'm not sorry
I'll take everything
I wouldn't give you
The time of day
You were my only
What can I say?
I'm not alone, no
'Cause I'm not alone
You think me deceiver
To show me the way
I wouldn't give you away
Away
I wouldn't give you
The time of day
You were my only
What can I say?
'Cause I'm not alone
