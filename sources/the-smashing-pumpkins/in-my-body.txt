The Smashing Pumpkins
In My Body

Hold silent
You were my violence stuck
In my life
Just for the moment
And let me under you
So you can die
I was alive
I was alive
In my body
You'll never find me
You'll never pull me out
In my body
The lonely creatures
The lonely creatures scream
June's offcast
Left hiding, I form the screams
Burned alive
Wasted sunsets
Haunting my torment
Right through my clothes
In my body
You'll never find me
You'll never pull me out
I was alive
I was alive
In my body
You'll never find me
You'll never pull me out
In my body
The lonely creatures
The lonely creatures scream
In my body
In my body
In my body, yeah
In my body
In my body
In my body, yeah
In my body
In my body
In my body, yeah
