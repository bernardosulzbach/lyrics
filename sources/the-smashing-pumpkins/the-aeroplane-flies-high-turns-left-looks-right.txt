The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)

Spoken:
"I really don't wanna look stupid when I'm sleeping
I never really liked sunny days
The black wings just reach out to me over a distance...
And I can feel the wind from the wings
I see the clouds, I feel the ocean with my feet, and I'm home again
It requires an ability to judge distance
The airplane flies high...turns left, looks right"
Love is a sentimental heart
Life is a sentimental way
Spy the fragile heart so cursed
As he walks across this earth
I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile
Spoken:
"If I knew where I was going I would already be there
(Laugh) I wish I had more time
Judicious, beautiful, uh, demented, whatever
I've always been afraid to die, but I think I'm more afraid to live"
And all I gave to you is lust
And all you took from me is lust
Black wings carry me so high
Up to meet you in the sky
I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile
Wishing you were real to me
Wishing i could make believe
I'll take my secrets to the grave
Safely held beneath the waves
Always knew I couldn't save
Always knew I couldn't save you
And in my heart I know you're there
And in my heart I know you care
And in my heart I know you're gone
