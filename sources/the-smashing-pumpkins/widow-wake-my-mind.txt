Widow Wake My Mind

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Widow wake my mind
Widow wake my mind
Widow wake my mind
Widow wake my mind
I'm looking for a love, a love that shines
That shines, a love that shines
To be mine, yes, all mine
A love that's mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Widow wake my mind
Widow wake my mind
Are you real this time?
Widow wake my mind
I'm looking for a love that I can find
To be mine, a love that's mine
It'll shine, in my mind
A love that shines
Accept the grace, the moment you are in
Accept the chase of where we must begin
'Cause when you crawl, you crawl into my heart
And when you fall, you fall right in my arms
We'll shine, yes, we'll shine
Our love will shine
You'll be mine, yes, all mine
Our love will shine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm looking for a love that I call mine
Shine, we'll shine
Widow wake my mind
Shine, we'll shine
Widow wake my mind
Shine, we'll shine
We'll shine
Widow wake my mind
Shine, we'll shine
We'll shine
Widow wake my mind
Shine, we'll shine
We'll shine
Widow wake my mind
Shine, we'll shine
We'll shine
Widow wake my mind
We'll shine
