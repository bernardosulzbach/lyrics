The Smashing Pumpkins
Snail

All your seven dreams
Are closer than you believe
As your things come undone
See you are the only one
Flower, seize the hour the day away
Waiting, waiting for your way away
When you wake up your own way
Throwing your life away
Softly siren coming home
Siren snail
It's what you wait for
Flower, the pain will wash away, away
When the sun shines
And climbs through your window
Into your bed
When you wake up your own way
Throwing your life away
Softly siren coming home
Siren snail
Yeah, that's my home
Flower, save the hours
Flower, away
It's what you wait for
Flower, chase the sunshine
Flower, chase the sunshine
Flower
