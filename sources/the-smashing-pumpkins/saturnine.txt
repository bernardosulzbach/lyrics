Saturnine

The clever make the world weary
To pull it from its moorings
To fawn the young wicked roost
To weather the coming storms
They are inside now
They are inside
They are inside now
Saturnine
How I love to waste your time
Saturnine
Saturnine
Goodbye all you widows
Tearstained underneath
Blessed to the many
Who are seeking some relief
They are inside
They are inside now
They are inside
They are inside
You'll always run
But you cannot find
Saturnine
Saturnine
Saturnine
You were waiting all this time
Saturnine
Saturnine
Camera take this picture
The wreckage is outside
Quick may you hurry
We are losing our light
We are inside now
We are inside
We are inside
You'll always run
But you'll never find
Saturnine
Saturnine
How I'd love to make you mine
Saturnine
Saturnine
To the ages I am speaking
To the creatures I am sky
Bloody simple features
Everyone chooses sides
Shatter this faith broken
Walk these summer miles
Leave here while forgotten
Carrying forth this child
Saturnine
