Wave Song

Waves over water 
My gaze washes over 
While you wave 
While you wave 
Summer dreams 
Your life drowns me 
Underwater 
You feel a quiver 
And i feel a sliver 
Wave over wave 
Over me 
Wave over wave 
Over me 
Over me 
Hey, love, come hold me 
Sliver across your belly 
And while you wait 
While you wait 
Life drowns me
