Waiting

please drive slow
i've never been this way before
violence reels in the underground
yes i am waiting
in silence thrown
to fill the meetings
to strike me down
no more a reason
then god above
let your curses run
yes i am waiting
for your love
radio waves of a dying sun
radio speaks my soul alone
forget my names, erase the page
and dinners draw the passengers
yes i am waiting
in silence thrown
my blood of treason
my tears of hope
no more a feeling
than being cold
of playing on
yes i am waiting
as i walk your street
yes i am waiting
as i ride your dreams
yes i am waiting
inside your doubts
inside your doubts
just let me out
just let me out
