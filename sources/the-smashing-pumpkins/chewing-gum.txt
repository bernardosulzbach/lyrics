Chewing Gum

chewing gum 
wonderin' where i've hid and what i've done 
wonderin' where i'll go and where i'll run 
hide myself away from everyone 
chewing gum 
doesn't bother you that you're not the one 
keeps you up at night in a fever dream 
to count the sinful pieces of your mystique 
it's yours to keep 
chewing gum 
innocence lost in electric smiles 
perfectly cast in desperate clothes 
lovingly hung from city lights 
with all their might 
and all i need is you by my side 
by my side 
by my side 
chewing gum 
wonderin' i've hid and what i've done 
wonderin' where i'll go and where i'll run 
hide myself away from everyone 
chewing gum 
got myself a piece of 
chewing gum 
got myself a piece of 
chewing gum 
got myself a piece of 
chewing gum 
got myself a piece of chewing gum
