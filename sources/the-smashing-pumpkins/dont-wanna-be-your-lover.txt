Don't Wanna Be Your Lover

if i speak my mind, will you hear me? 
if i reach to you, will you feel me? 
if i kissed you, would you love me? 
one less moment to break your heart 
one less love to tear apart 
don't want to be your lover 
don't want to be your friend 
the spell we've surrendered 
so just let me pretend 
you don't exist 
our connection is fixed 
one more arrow to pierce your soul 
one more chance to let go 
in the mountain song, sing the echoes 
in the long meadows, chasin' shadows 
in the endless night you whisper endless praise 
swear to god that you won't change 
don't want to be your lover 
don't want to be your friend 
faith takes me over 
so just let me pretend 
you're not real 
visions surreal 
spirit channels 
don't want to be your lover 
don't want to be your friend 
if i fall in love, will you forgive me? 
if i lose my way, will you choose me? 
if i change my mind, will you change me?
