The Smashing Pumpkins
Sunkissed

To make thee mine
I cast a net as wide as I am free
Line by line
Erase the schemes that I have drawn to be
There's no fear anymore
Crystalline the truth, assumes the breeze
There's no fear anymore
Burn the bridge outside
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
If I can't live without you
I feel alone walking home All by myself
I've never chased a brighter sun than you'll become
I mistook you for a trust
Invocations I must dust off
Fresh bouquets to playfully collect
Even though you've seen the show
I've saved the best for last
A cannonball shot stern to bow
To warn the crowd
I fall in love from my guts
My arms are twined to switch
And in repose, a silent rose
Burns the bridge outside
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
To make thee mine
I call upon the wisdom of my age
Blow by blow
Chase the bees of the death song's wings
There's no crying anymore
Crystalline, the bridges burn outside
Stitches will all come undone
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
What comes must all come out at once
Of us
                                                                                                
If I'm gonna live
If I'm gonna live
Without you
I've never chased a brighter sun than you'll become
What comes will all, the breaking dawn
But I'm on its side
