The Smashing Pumpkins
Nothing and Everything

Hiding behind my hair today
My eyes dance with fire
The thought of living here
And the bounds I transpire
Walking in this slow-motion now
I think you've made so bad
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath
The grave that bears my name
Started a dream
A dream, immortality
Yet I fall in vain
Just as long as I don't breathe
I'll never be like them
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart
My heart
Hiding behind my hair today
Wishing I was far away
Walking in this slow-motion town
I seem to be so bad
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart
My heart
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
If you go and I would stay
You would call my name
I would die, yes, I would die
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart
My heart
