Signal to Noise

begin the chase
down the rabbit hole
we shall go
to love again
oh dearest one
there's little i don't believe
that won't reveal
our love against
all concealed
so if you'll take me
as i am
oh you won't break me
or halve this man
what's born must die tonight
so kill me love
one more time
just kill me love
one more time
for all time
you're mine
it never stops
this rain inside my heart
won't get caught
in love again
behind the wheel
of a dead end deal
destroying light
to live against
all i feel
so if you'll take me
as i am
this man outrageous
this who i am
don't understand how i fall
so kill me love
one more time
just kill me love
one more time
for all time
you're mine
