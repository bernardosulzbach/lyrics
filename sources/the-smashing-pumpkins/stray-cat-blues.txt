Stray Cat Blues

[reel time studios acoustic sessions version]
i hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
i know you're no scare-eyed honey.
there'll be a feast if you just come upstairs
but it's no hanging matter
it's no capital crime
i can see you're just fifteen years old
i don't want your i.d
so sad cause you're so far from home
it's no hanging matter
it's no capital crime
oh yeah
stray stray cat oh yeah
scratch my back, oh yeah
bet your momma never saw you scratched my back
bet she never saw you scratch my back
you're so scared cause you're so far from home
and you really miss your mother
and i can see you so scared of home
it's no hanging matter
it's no capital crime
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
and i can say girlfriend wider than you
why don't you bring her upstairs
she's so wild, she can't join in too
it's no hanging matter
it's no capital crime
oh yeah
stray stray cat, oh yeah
scratch my back, oh yeah
bet your momma never saw you scratch my back
bet she never saw you scratch my back
