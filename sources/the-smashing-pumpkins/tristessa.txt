Tristessa

Pledge of faith I hardly break
Struggle to return 
Blurry mind so hypnotized
Fast enough to burn 
Wonder where you are? 
Tristessa 
Soul take soul as eye take eye 
I will wait for you 
Want to believe your wish to receive 
Want to believe in you 
Hang on to your life 
Tristessa 
I love you true 
Surely I do 
 
Did you ever wake up and find yourself alone? 
Did you ever wake up far from home? 
Want to believe your wish to receive 
Want to believe in you 
Tristessa
