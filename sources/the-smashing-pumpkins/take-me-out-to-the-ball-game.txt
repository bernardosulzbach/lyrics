The Smashing Pumpkins
Take Me Out to the Ball Game

Take me out to the ball game
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks
I don't care if I never get back
Let me root, root, root for the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
For it's one, two, three strikes you're out
At the old ball game!
