The Smashing Pumpkins
Once in a While

horses run once in a while for you
the shades will drop once in a while for you
destiny will have a sense of your touch
once in a while
once in a while for you
once in a while for you
once in a while for you
the soldiers will fall once in a while for you
the shades will crawl once in a while for you
you'll take the walls
i will take the pain awayonce in a while
once in a while it's you
once in a while it's you
once in a while
you'll make it on your own
you'll make it so alone
feel so alone
you'll try to care once in a while for me
i will be there once in a while
once in a while for you
once in a while for you
once in a while for you
