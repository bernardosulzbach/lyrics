Heaven

Day is ending
Birds are wending
Back to their shelter of
Each little nest they love 
Nightshade's falling
Lovebirds calling
What makes the world go round
Nothing but love
When whippoorwills call
And evening is nigh
I hurry to my blue heaven
I turn to the right
A little white light
Will lead you to my blue heaven
You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest
That's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Molly and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven
You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest
That's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Molly and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven
We're happy in my blue heaven
