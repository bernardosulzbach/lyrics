Blew Away

Blew, blew away
But I don't wanna fade
Blew, blew, ooh
And if you love her
Ya know it will come true
And if you need her
Ya know that she'll be there
Stay awake, I lie here
With her and I fall
And when I wake inside you
I know you know
I'm yours
Blew, blew away
But I don't wanna fade
Blew, blew, ooh
And if you're sad, too
Until the angel sings and touches you
Don't confuse my only life
I said blew
And please don't ever leave
And I will greive, and member thee
Hope to meet you there
And I wanna let her know
That I won't let her go
I, I wanna let her know
That I love her so
And blew, blew, blew away
But I don't wanna
Blew, blew, I love you
Blew, blew
