The Smashing Pumpkins
Lightning Strikes

Life on telephones/Love on open roads
Into great unknowns I stumble brightly
Indigo/breathless yet
I'll link to your regret
Sunflowers as teachers pets/Bent from lightning
I'll bet/I'll bend for you
Shadows give your light to me
Shadows give your light to me
In the ways the city pours itself out
You can make this happen
Beyond your doubt
You can make this happen all right now
Eastern days I'm unafraid/cause love to me is such a game
That I believe I can't embrace/the dreams of lovers
Shadows give your light to me
Shadows give your light to me
In the ways the city pours itself out
You can make this happen
Beyond your doubt
You can make this happen all right now
Zen baby/lightning strikes
The same heart/but never twice
Zen baby/we've got to fight
What's real and what becomes the night
In the ways the city pours itself out
You can make this happen
Beyond your doubt
You can make this happen all right now
