Alabaster

My mouth is full of hooks
silly answer
who'll know?
My eyes are full of time
bitter and alone
who'll show?
i know, i know, i know
doesnt it show?
i know, i know, i know
and you got me on a line
ready to unwind
who'll show?
you'd love to see me cry
you'd love to see me cry
to cry
you'd love to see me cry
when were born to show the way
when were born to show the way
you know we all stay
anyone
alabaster, alabaster, take me home
alabaster, alabaster, take me home
anyone can see
you and i
you and me tonight
you'd love to see me cry
you'd love to see me cry
you'd love to try
i know you want to
