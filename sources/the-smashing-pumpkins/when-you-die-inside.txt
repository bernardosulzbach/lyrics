The Smashing Pumpkins
When You Die Inside

(Play somethin' -hard-? ...You got the wrong band, man...)
{Jackie Blue!}
I'm right here
Lying with you
[....completely unintelligible...]
They found her in her car
In the river, deep and dark
They found her in her car
In the river, deep and dark
She told me things I didn't want to hear
She said:
When you lie inside
When you lie outside
You die a thousand deaths, you motherfucker
When you die inside
When you die inside
You know what it means
