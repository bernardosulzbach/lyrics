I don't want to fight
Every single night
Everything I want is in your eyes
You and me go back
To places I don't know to care
The spoils of all I got were left as scraps
Don't let me say this
But you're no worse than me
It's crazy
You're as real as real ever was
Just because you feel you've had enough
You believe that someone gave us up
I wanna be there when you're happy
I wanna love you when you're sad
Can't stand the morning rain
Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun
Close your eyes, you'll see
The angel dies
I don't wanna be anything believes
A million watts of sound can't compare
Come along, you'll see the world
The the crowd unfolds
The college starts to flow, and then you're home
Oh, is the White House all they want?
I'll sing for
You're as real as real ever was
Just because you're every living soul
You're so real that someone gave us up
Don't break the oath
I wanna love you when you're happy
Don't break the soul
I wanna be there when you're sad
Retain the pouring rain
The unreal, as real as any loss
Too easy now
The unreal in every living soul
Dumb day now
Can't stand the blazing sun
Can't stand the morning rain
Ah, get out, I'll take your place again
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone, no
If it's the White House all they want
Black house they'll get
