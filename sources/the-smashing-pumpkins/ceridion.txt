The Smashing Pumpkins
Ceridion

They watch their eyes close
Unwatching
They think their so fearless
Immagical
They try and taek away what you came for,
They tried to make you lose your mind before
Oh Ceridion
Your nothing but a b*tch
Oh Ceridion
You think your something like a witch.
Dont give us your bullsh*t answers
Dont act like a bullshit fascist
Ceridion.
