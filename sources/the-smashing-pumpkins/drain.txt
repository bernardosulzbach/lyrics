Drain

may i walk beside your shadow, softly 
bless the ground you walk upon so easy 
innocence, come to me 
squandered in anarchy 
can i drain your body of its fever 
turn my cheek while you are weak and starving 
we all know who you are 
what you've become, you're a star 
sweet dreams you don't want to change 
by means at your own hands 
remote and isolated 
predoubt all that you see 
innocence, come to me and be your belief and see 
may i walk beside your shadow, softly 
bless the ground you walk upon so easy
