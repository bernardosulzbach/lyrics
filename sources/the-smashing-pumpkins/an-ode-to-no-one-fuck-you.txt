The Smashing Pumpkins
An Ode to No One (Fuck You)

I'm never coming back 
I'm never giving in 
I'll never be the shine in your spit 
I disconnect the act 
I disconnect the dots 
I disconnect the me in me 
And you're mistaken it's you that's faking 
Living and breathing and dying too 
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool 
You can't bring me back you can't bring me back 
Cause I gave it all back to you 
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks 
Wreak their havoc upon this world 
The disenchanted, the romantics, 
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole 
Destroy the mind-destroy the body-but you cannot destroy the heart 
And you, you make me so I need to disconnect 
And you make it so real 
I don't need your love to disconnect 
To runaround kids in get-go cars 
With Vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs 
Galaxies full of nobodies 
Giving us the farewell runarounds 
I took a virgin Mary axe to his sweet baby Jane, 
Lost my innocence to a no good girl, scratch my face with anvil hands, 
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth 
And I give it all back to you 
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect 
And you make it, so real, I don't need your love to disconnect 
No way to disconnect 
And you make it so real 
I don't need your love to disconnect 
No way to disconnect
