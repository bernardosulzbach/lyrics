Cupid De Locke

Cupid hath pulled back hi sweetheart's bow 
To cast divine arrows into her soul 
To grab her attention swift and quick 
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick 
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows 
See the devil may do as the devil may care 
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare 
Her mouth the mischief he doth seek 
Her heart the captive of which he speaks 
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound 
Your world be shattered with nary a note 
Of one cupids arrow under your coat 
And in the land of star crossed lovers 
And barren hearted wanderers 
Forever lost in forsaken missives and Satan's pull 
We seek the unseekable and we speak the unspeakable 
Our hopes dead gathering dust to dust 
In faith, in compassion, and in love
