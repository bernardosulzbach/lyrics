Glass' Theme

shattering fast 
i'm glass, i'm glass 
i'm shattering fast 
i'm glass, i'm glass 
i'm shattering, shattering 
glass, glass, glass 
i'm shattering fast 
i'm glass, i'm glass 
i've got a lot of tears 
in a blood-stained jar 
it's been a real long time 
since i walked the fine line 
you put up the walls 
you put up the walls 
hold all my calls 
i'll be by the pool 
won't you please 
worship me 
won't you love 
what i adore 
all alone 
in my soul 
i betrayed 
rock and roll 
rock and roll 
rock and roll 
rock and roll 
rock and roll 
everybody knows i'm last, i'm last 
and everybody knows i'm fast, i'm fast 
i'm shattering, shattering 
glass, glass, glass 
i'm shattering fast 
i'm glass, i'm glass 
you put up the walls 
hold all my calls 
'cause i'll be by the pool 
playing with my guns 
'cause there's nowhere to run 
'cause i'm the one you love now 
staying after school 
breaking all your rules 
shattering fast 
shattering glass 
shattering glass 
i'm shattering glass
