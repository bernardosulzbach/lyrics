Again, Again, Again (The Crux)

I love you
I don't even care
If it takes my life for heaven unaware
Sin for sin, I've let you in
And still I'm fucked
So put my heart on your chopping block
And feed me fire
But don't let go
Hey, don't let go
Don't let go
Again, again, again
When will I see you again
Before the world should end
When will I see you again
When will I see you again
Again
Struck deeply
Some never heal
Caught beyond the risen I could steal
Judgment day comes every day to us all
So fall in love only if you must
But don't let go
Hey don't let go
Don't let go
 
Again, again, again
When will I see you again
Before the world should end
When will I see you again
It never stops the starting up
the atrophy, the cruel enough
this vision of oblivion
And when it ends it all begins
Start again and then you're in
So grab my hand should you believe there's a destiny
                                                                                                
When will I see you again
When will I see you
Again, again, again
When will I see you again
Before the world should end
When will I see you again
