The Smashing Pumpkins
A Trip Unto Bountiful

Waiting, I've been waiting
And you're here
Oh, yeah
Starting, I'm starting
Waiting
Oh, yeah
I will be tough
I will be tough
On this rooftop
Oh, yeah
One step closer to you
In the pain
Reaching, reaching to
Oh, you
You are you
I will be tough
I will be tough
I will be tough
I will be tough
