Mama

Mama, you're on my mind
A stitch upon my coda
Play on the world's grand design
I think you know
I think you're sure that you know that
Butterflies don't get old
And I don't get so young anymore
What a shame
The big ideas
And lost ideals, it's a show
I must appear in control
Mama
Mama
The show at all
They're burning books outside of
What was it that you said?
And to the walls
Let the spirit gather up and
Set us a flame for
Year to year, there's no one here but us
What I'm ask
The ears to the ground and the fingers on the pulse of the pain
Oh it's worse than change
Oh what do they want with us
Oh mama
Mama
What is it that they want with us and all of our abuse
Oh what's the use to protect
Mama, is only you
You're a dancer from the mirrors of
Lie and with restraint
This quiet warmth
I've got my faith restored by the sway of the trees
That sway in time to one more rhyme of my curse
But what it's worth
I count you out and still you count me in
To answer your final bell
Mama
Mama
But why do they care about us
Mama
Mama
They knock and knock
But I don't answer the door
Mama
Mama
Cuz I'm bored and we're not alone
