Anaise!

Anaise! Anaise! You're the captive's code
In a word, a word I can't let go
I need myself, you haunt me Anaise
In a fonce, a sign of lonely ones
When you're here, to nash, what's done is done
It's simply cold, the spiders all crawl on me
Oh, what becomes of us as lovers?
Oh, send this bag away
Lovers let me hear from you
As you, oh, go on down, honey
Love you, Anaise
Anaise! Anaise! What's spread is blown
Are your times black hearts and laced?
And I miss? Now don't ya? Anais
Oh, what becomes of us as lovers?
Oh, send this bag away
Lovers letters hear from you
As you go asunder
Oh, send this bag away
If I could?
Suppose I'd tell
It's all lost 
To race against her will
Imagine way the and twilight by yourself
Oh, just stand within the breaks
Oh, what becomes of us as lovers?
Oh, send this bag away
Lovers let us hear from you
As you all go under, Anaise
Love you Anaise
