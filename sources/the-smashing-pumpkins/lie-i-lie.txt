Lie I Lie

what i say 
i just don't know 
motherfuckers coming down hard on you 
can i say 
i don't wanna go 
this is where i wanna be 
right here with you 
lie i lie 
lie i lie 
you got your freedom 
and that's not like you do 
motherfuckers coming down hard on you 
freedom, the reason we are here 
and born like a sucker 
ain't that the dream? 
lie i lie 
lie i lie 
what i say 
i just don't know 
motherfuckers coming down hard on you 
well can i say 
i don't wanna go 
this is where i wanna be 
right here with you 
lie i lie 
lie i lie
