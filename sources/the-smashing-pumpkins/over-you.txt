Over You

Over you like an angel
Over you like an angel
Over you like an angel
I am here and you are there
I will walk without despair
This is what I have to do
Suffer me as I suffer you
I am one as you are three
I will walk my baby
Your insane heart, your keen disguise
And you wash it away
Over you like an angel
Over you like an angel
Your insane heart, your keen disguise
And you wash it
I'm a super-powered elevator
I'm gonna climb so high
See you down
See you down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Your insane heart, your keen disguise
And you wash it
I'm a super-powered elevator
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
