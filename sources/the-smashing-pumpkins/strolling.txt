The Smashing Pumpkins
Strolling

Rollin' with the breeze
Do what you please
I guess you'd say
We'll take the whole day
Skip out of school
Run around and act like
The fools that we are
Ain't gonna do anyone any harm
Train whistle at our backs
Laid our pennies down the tracks
Forget our cares
I guess you'd say
We'll take the whole day
Go for a swim
Dry off in the wind
The sun's goin' down so we better get back
It's too easy to stay
So lazy, hazy, maybe crazy
Rollin' with the breeze
Do what you please
So take it easy, yes, please
Strollin' with the leaves
