A Stitch in Time

It's just a stitch in time
It's perfect, I don't mind
Sailing on your endless sea
You're perfect, I don't mind
I've got your stitch in mine
Everywhere I wanna be
Don't say you want too much
They'll say you've had enough
Don't let them lay their trips on you
There's somewhere I just gotta be...
You're everywhere at once, and you can't break free...
You're everywhere at once, and you can't catch me, watch out
There's somewhere I just gotta be
It's just a stitch in time
We fit together fine
A puzzle looking for its piece
You're perfect, I don't mind
Your travel makes you mine
Everywhere I look I see
Don't say you want too much
They'll say you've had enough
Don't let them lay their trips on you
There's somewhere I just gotta be...
You're everywhere at once, and you can't break free...
You're everywhere at once, and you can't catch me, watch out
There's somewhere I just gotta be...
