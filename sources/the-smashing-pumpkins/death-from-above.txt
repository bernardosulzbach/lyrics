Death from Above

a little hunger
a little wonder of
death from above
death from above
oh mary mary
what are we askin of
death from above
yes love im sinkin
i wonder just how far
what was i thinkin
of when i fell apart
i see the moon move
cover me under the spell
i see the few souls
cover me hungry and cold
i know the first thing
running up under your path
i know this can't last
death from above
shoot here comes
death from above
a little reject
a simple conjure of
death from above
you rock n rollers
you sudden victims of
death from above
oh death from above
yes love im sinkin
i hunger where you are
whats left but notice
to notice just how far
i see the moon light
cover me under the spell
i see the few souls
beggin bury us now
i know the valleys
running up under my path
i know the (spare leaves ?)
death from above
oh here comes death from above
oh lord im sinking
i just dont know how far
its death from above
yes love im sinking
i hunger where you are
death from above
death from above
yes lord im thinking of
death from above
yes lord im thinking of
death from above
