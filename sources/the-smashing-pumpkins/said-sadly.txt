The Smashing Pumpkins
...Said Sadly

JI=James Iha, NG=Nina Gordon (of Veruca Salt), J+N=both) 
JI: You should know that I love you 
We should love like lovers do 
And I can't help but fall for you 
Oh honey I'm just a fool 
Now you know 
NG: Darling, I'll never be true 
You see, for so long I was blue 
JI: I'm not the lonely one 
NG: And if I hurt, then you will, too 
Oh honey I always lose 
Now you know 
J+N: Lover, when will you? 
JI: I'm so afraid that noone cares 
J+N: Lover, can't find you 
JI: I swear to God don't leave me here 
J+N: Now you know 
J+N: Only you know that it can't be 
When noone else here really means 
JI: Anything to me 
J+N: If you hurt inside 
If you confide in me again 
NG: Since you ran away 
JI: Hold me now, tell me how 
Nothing's lost 
J+N: Lover, when will you? 
I'm so afraid that noone cares 
Lover, can't find you 
And noone knows what brings us here 
Lover 
JI: Hold me now 
NG: Hold me now 
JI: Tell me how 
J+N: Nothings lost
