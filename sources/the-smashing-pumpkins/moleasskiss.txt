My bed of roses 
In this sea of pain 
Smoke in those poses 
Postures and refrains 
A million ways 
To break your back 
Still undecided 
If i'm coming back 
Hello to you my friends 
We'll be together in the end 
No doubt about it 
You can be sure 
No doubt about it 
To all you buzzards 
And debutantes 
I give you this reply 
Take anything you want 
Just know illusion 
Cause i'll lose myself again, yeah 
Hello to you my friends 
We'll be together in the end 
No doubt about it 
You can be sure 
No doubt about it
