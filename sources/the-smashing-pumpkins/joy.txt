Joy

I feel joy
I feel just
Like a boy
You know I
Play with my toys
Nothing's really changed
I don't feel sad
You know I
Don't feel bad for my age
I'm happy just being
Someone just like me
In a way you will be
Any way in and
The world pulls me down and down
The world pulls me right on down and
The world spills me right on down
The world drains me right on down and
I feel joy
I feel just
Like a boy
You know I
Play with my noise
Nothing's really changed
I feel joy
I feel such
Happy joy
As I shout out
All the noise
Buildings crashing down
Happy just to be alive
Happy just to survive
The world as it drags me down
The world pulls me right on down and
The world drags me right on down
The world spills me right on down and...
Right on down and...
