Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child 
Softly stolen under our blanket skies 
And rescue me from me  and all that I believe 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Will you leave me too? 
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree 
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabies 
And tell me I am still 
The man I'm supposed to be 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Will you leave me too? 
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound 
And I am changing, changing 
And if we died right now, this fool you love somehow 
Is here with you 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Would you leave me too?
