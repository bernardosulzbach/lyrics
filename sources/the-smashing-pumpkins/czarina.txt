The Smashing Pumpkins
Czarina

Sipping Tea
Let the rivers pass me by
These dusty tears
Need no place to cry
I need no reason for the first time in my life
I just need to be on my way
I don't want for anything that I don't have
All I want is waiting for me there for me there
With my Czarina queen of all that I breathe
Still born seasons cradle our affairs
I light a candle
My lover to protect
And seclaw the ashes
My lover will descend
I need no reason for the first time in my life
I just need to be on my way
I don't want for anything that I don't have
All I want is waiting for me there
I don't want for anything that I don't have
All I want is waiting for me there for me there
And behind your walls
I waste the day
If I want
All this and more are under me
I need no reason for the first time in my life
I just need to be on my way
I don't want for anything that I don't have
All I want is waiting for me there
I don't want for anything that I don't have
All I want is waiting for me there
For me there
For me there
