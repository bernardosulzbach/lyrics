Run2me

Run to me, run to me
Where the sun
Never leaves
Run to me, my special love
Run to me
At first perceptions before yourself
Who came and sung from where you are?
You can escape this, by someone else
Your lover?
Run to me, run to me
My special one, run to me
Run to me, run to me
My lover strange
Run to me, you can't be changed
Run to me, run to me
Where the frogs spoils the lean
Run to me, run to me
As the desert rose
Desert dreams
Run to me, my tempest age, run to me
