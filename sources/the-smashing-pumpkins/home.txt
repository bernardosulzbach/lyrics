Home

We'll wander off through the dead of night
Past wastelands of shattered souls
Warm by my firelight
I peer into the darkness alone
As the Indian summer of my remembrance
Settles on my bones
Cracked and weary, I ask for direction home
Home, let the word spill from my mouth
Love, love is everything I want
I'm one of many more to come
Love, love is everything I want
Crossroads outside of town
The heartbroken faces shine
The city lights so far and dull
Turning left I know it's time
With an urgent wind upon my rolling heals
To carry me along
My face downcast, I turn to ruins past and home
Home, let the word spill from my mouth
Love, love is everything I want
I'm one of many more to come
Love, love is everything I want
We'll wander off through the dead of night
Past terrors and broken homes
Wipe the sleep from under your eyes
Of riverbanks and catacombs
Sleep into the bee and the sea
I was to live this life alone
Lay down Caligula
Cry out, I know it's time
Love is everything I want
Love is everything I want
Love is everything I want
Love is everything I want
