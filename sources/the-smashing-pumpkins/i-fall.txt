I Fall

it makes no difference to me
if i die in my sleep tonight
i'm sick to the bone
and longing for home
my blood runs white
and i didn't want anyone
and i didn't want anyone
to be hurt by my words
if there's pain in hell, i'm feeling it today
wishing i were seven in a children's heaven
how heavy the world weighs
how heavy the world weighs
how heavy the world weighs
how heavy the world weighs
ghosts don't cry
and the dead don't die
they walk hand in hand
as if partners in crime
partners in crime
i fall
on and on and on down
i fall
on and on and on down
i'm falling down
on and on and on down
i fall
on and on and on down
the world could feed you love
but it's me you've come to despise
like a head on a plate of purity
playing judas iscariot
in the hands of sanctity
how heavy the world weighs
how heavy the world weighs
when one must carry the world
i fall
on and on and on down
i fall
on and on and on down
i'm falling down
on and on and on down
i'm falling down
on and on
i fall down
i fall down
when you're not around
i fall
on and on and on down
i fall down
on and on and on
on and on and on
on and on and on down
i fall down
i fall down
how heavy the world weighs
how heavy the world weighs
