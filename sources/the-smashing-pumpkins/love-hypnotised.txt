Love (Hypnotised)

To my mistakes  to my mistakes of cowardice 
She shimmy shakes  the Jimmy Jakes of consequence 
Born of the airs and dues  my airs of madness do declare 
That it's o.k.  it's love 
It's what you wanted to see  it's who you wanted to be 
For what you needed to need  she'll make it up 
Love  it's who you know 
Machine gun blues  her vacant rush is so steel 
I'm unaware  lost inside your visions 
I got mine too over, I got mine and I got you 
'Cause I know you, you're love 
It's what you wanted to see, it's who you wanted to be 
For what you needed to need, she'll make it up 
Love, it's who you know 
When I lost my mind, I knew I was in for a long time
Can I look up to you as you look down on me 
Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me 
I can't help what you see, I can't help but to be 
For what I needed to need, she'll make it 
Love, it's who you know
