As Rome Burns

We are the new gods 
same as the old gods 
we’ll take all your blood 
and turn it into mud 
as Rome burns 
one by one 
two by two 
together they ride 
side by side 
into love 
together they die 
and still they want to weather the tide 
as Rome burns 
Forgiveness all your days 
to count what you can’t save 
we’ll take out one good eye 
and leave a world to fall behind 
as Rome burns 
I see them everywhere out shaking to the beat 
cursing out their elements 
with chaos, chaos bleats 
and what seemed urgent then turns wicked in the heat 
as Rome burns to the motherfucking ground.
