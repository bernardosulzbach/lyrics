Farewell and Goodnight

Goodnight, to every little hour that you 
Sleep tight, may it hold you through the winter of a 
Long night, and keep you from the loneliness of yourself
Heart strung, is your heart frayed and empty cause it's 
Hard luck, when no one understands your love it's
Unsung, and I say
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart
Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your
Head light, with the wishes of a sandman and a 
Night light, be careful not to let the bedbugs
Sleep tight, nestled in your covers
The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
And you can tell, it's just as well
And you can tell, it's just as well
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always to all that's pure that's in your heart
