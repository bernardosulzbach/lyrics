Jesus Is the Sun

christ knows 
as christ grows 
christ shows nothing but love 
jesus 
can you hear me 
my pain is echoed through you 
is your head filled with lies 
and do you despise me if i try 
if i try, why, why 
jesus is the sun 
you won't miss me 
like i miss you too 
you'll be sorry 
like i'm sorry, why 
it's not easy 
when you're on your own 
my love's weakness 
your love's strength and bone 
is your head filled with lies 
and do you despise me if i try 
why 
jesus is the sun 
christ knows 
as christ grows 
christ shows nothing but love 
but love
