And on her doorstep I saw that I was blind
I'd forsaken what was mine
What it mattered, mattered little now
We had shattered, apart somehow
I can't help but stay the same
I'll remain true to my name
Time to get up and take the long walk home
For the first time I go alone
Do you remember when we first met
Chasing down the alleyways behind my dad's
I can't help but stay the same
I remain true to the name of lovers past
Good enough to lose
And good enough to chose you too
