The Smashing Pumpkins
F.O.L.

I sense your not avowed
I know there's death around
I catch the damage in the air;
I got the skull and bones
I lick the polished chrome
There's magic everywhere
Can I please just talk with you
Fear is deep and shaded blue [?]
I used to smile
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Feel Our Love
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Feel Our Love
Feel Our Love
Feel Our Love
Oh feel love ain't too much
For I love what I sung
What I've sung
I split in half
Now it's always
However you and I;
Love is always
Fun;
A single cross to bear
A team he proves are there
Where we won't we've got a night
The night begins a waste
It's all a bit to fake
Someone killer lines [Someone kill her eyes?]
It's failing something I could do
Tower spits I have the fuse
If I want I can't refuse
Jesus, now.
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Feel Our Love
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Come on and feel our love
Feel Our Love
Feel Our Love
Feel Our Love
If love ain't now
For I love what I sung
What I've sung
To reflect to the one;
What I've sung
I split it in half
Now it's always
However you and I;
Love is always
on Fire;
Feel our love;
C'mon and feel our love;
Just feel our love;
