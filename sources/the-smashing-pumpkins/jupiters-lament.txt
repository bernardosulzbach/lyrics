Jupiter's Lament

Gone, long gone
We can all be gone, gone, gone
Leave this world all wrong, wrong, wrong
Leave it far behind
And although my secret's gone
I'll try to carry on
If I must, I'll get along without you
Gone, long gone
Leave this world all wrong, wrong, wrong
Beyond the pale and dawn
Free these mortal bonds
No one knows I can't be wrong
Still l sing the same old song
I tried to be strong for you
Why have you left me?
Amongst the tall trees
I know I gave her all I had
And I tied her heart in ribbons
And I tied her heart in ribbons
I tied her heart in ribbons and bows
And I'm gone
Oh yes, I'm gone
And I'm lost without you
I'm lost within you
And I'm gone, so gone, long gone
