Ugly

Don't look in the mirror
I don't like what I see staring back at me
Everything is clearer
I'll never see what you see
It's not me
So beautiful and free
I'll never be what you need
I can't help it at all
I was born so beautiful
But now I'm ugly
And I rot in my skin
As a piece of me dies everyday
I know I'm nothing
I know there's nothing I can say
To change
The judgment in their ways
I'll never be what you need
I can't help it at all
My love was so beautiful
But now I'm ugly
Yeah
I'm good enough, but I don't care
I'm good enough, but I'm not there
I'm good enough, but I don't care
The sun is out, but I'm not there
(I can go anywhere) I'm good enough, but I don't care (somewhere)
(I can go anywhere) The sun is out, but I'm not there (somewhere)
(I can go anywhere) I'm good enough (somewhere)
(I can go anywhere) I'm good enough (somewhere)
I don't look in the mirror
I don't like what I see staring back at me
Everything is clearer
I'll never see what you see
And I rot in my skin
As a piece of me dies everyday
I know I'm nothing
Because I'm ugly
