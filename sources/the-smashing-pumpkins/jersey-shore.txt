Jersey Shore

On the Jersey Shore
Send all our dimes
I was getting change
Back of my mind
Shooting blanks
In Jerseytown
We tunnelled in
Manhattan-bound
What can we do?
There's life there for me
With a sweet young thing
And a cool, cool breeze
To a smokestack chime
We carry forth
Cinder child
And nights we forced
They are saints hovering
The lost soul is carried down
Let him go on a riverbed
God rest your soul
God rest this town
What should we do?
There's life here for me
With a sweet young thing
And a cool, cool breeze
Say a prayer for me
In the pinball din
Done with glow
Dream the Jersey Shore
We kiss in here
On the Jersey Shore
Is where I died
Hat in hand
My eyes to the sky
