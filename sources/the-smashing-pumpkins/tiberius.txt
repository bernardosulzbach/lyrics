Hush my love don't fight
Never leave here this night
Once bright don't fade
What is love, love, old ache
Let freedoms in flight
May stray from our right
Never leave here softly
I've seen the world
Upon a thousand dreams
Your eyes are one that
Can't see what it means
Yet still I love you
Like everything
Goes and goes
It goes
If you break believe me
If you take deceive me
To the sound of one clapping hand
Is your heart so lonely
If your own only
As good as can be had on that
Hush my love don't fight
Never leave here this night
I've seen the world
On a thousand dreams
Your eyes are one that
Can't see what it means
Yet still I love you
Like everything
Goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes
I've seen the world
Upon a thousand dreams
I've seen the world
Upon a thousand dreams
It goes and goes
Goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes
