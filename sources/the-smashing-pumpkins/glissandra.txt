Glissandra

I know that we are young.
And I know you may love me.
But I just can't be with you like this anymore.
Glissandra.
She's got both hands
in her pocket.
And she won't look at you,
Won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo.
She's got a halo 'around her finger.
Around you.
You know that I love you boy.
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I gotta choose,
nothing to loose.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarrette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.
Glissandra.
Glissandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
(Just stop. Please. Just let me go. Glissandra. Just let me go.)
She's not broken,
She's just a baby.
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad.
and all those flames that burned before him.
Now he's gonna fight your fight, gonna cool the bad.
You know that I love you boy.
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I gotta choose,
nothing to loose
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.
Glissandra.
Glissandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
Gle-ny-sandra. [2x]
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me. Glissandra
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Starla.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Glissandra.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch. Starla.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.
