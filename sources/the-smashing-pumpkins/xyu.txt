The Smashing Pumpkins
X.Y.U.

She didn't want to be  she didn't want to know 
She couldn't run away cause she was crazy 
She gave it all away  she saw her baby break 
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors 
And I said  I want to fill you up  I want to break you  I want to give you up 
From one another  another one should come to one another 
No one should come between us 
Still I was lonely  and she was by my side  my one and only 
Knows that she could never hide 
I couldn't feel her, and it was just a game, 
'Cause I was lonely and she was crazy 
Rat-tat-tat, ka boom boom, now take that, and just a bit of this 
'Cause I'm a watcher, and I'm a doer of none 
Come to save you, cause you're all mine 
I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt 
I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine 
Ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat, and some good ole bliss 
Cause I'm a sister, and I'm a motherfuck 
I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff 
I am never enough, I am the forgotten child 
And I said I want to fill you up, I want to break you, I want to give you up 
From one another, no one should ever come 
In between us, between us and our love 
Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow 
And everywhere that Mary went I was sure to go 
Now Mary's got a problem, and Mary's not a stupid girl 
Mary's got some deep shit, and Mary does not forget 
And this is how Mary's garden grows, and this is how Mary has her ghosts 
And into the eyes of the jackyl I say ka-boom 
Ow we begin descent, to where we've never been 
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last 
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve 
And she will never learn [she will never learn] 
Bye bye, baby goodbye [bye bye]
