this is where i've left my friends
some are real and some pretend
all of you, you knew me well
'cause i've never ever been
this strong
now i know
now i'm strong
i don't want it
unless you've got a lot for me
when you wanted
to breathe
through me
to be
through me
desire me
[?]
desire me
[?]
right through you
