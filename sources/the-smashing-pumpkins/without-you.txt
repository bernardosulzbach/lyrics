The Smashing Pumpkins
Without You

Let's aim to be
The bumblebees
Let's aim to please
The deep blue seas
The gent weep of everything
Without you
Within you
Beside you
Fell into a bad dream
Without you
Without you
Let's aim to see
The deep blue sky
Let's aim to squeeze
The last drops out of life
Without you
Within you
Beside you
Fell into the worst dream
Without you
Without you
