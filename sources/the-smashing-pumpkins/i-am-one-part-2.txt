I Am One (Part 2)

Like the sun, yeah, I am one
Raising forth when I'm done
So high in the sky
And we'd say what we'd say
And we'd do as we please
And we'd break every rule
On our knees
Like the sun, yeah, I am one
Raising forth when I'm done
What you wait for in the sky, high, up high
And we'd break every rule
And we'd do as we please
And we'd drink what we want
On our knees
