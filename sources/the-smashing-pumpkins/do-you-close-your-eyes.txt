Do You Close Your Eyes

do you close your eyes when you kiss me 
do you close your eyes if you miss me 
and do you wonder why 
i sent for you tonight 
do you wonder why 
golden bells are ringing in the year 
through all the tears you cried for me 
i always knew you could 
so hide inside your looking-glass surprise 
the lies become the truth you hide 
the lies become the lusty night 
do you close your eyes when you kiss me 
do you close your eyes if you miss me 
and do you wonder why 
i sent for you tonight 
do you wonder why 
do you dream your dreams when you're with me 
and do you see the things that i see 
and is it true enough 
is it true of love 
secrets cloud your ears and fill your nights 
with compromise and shadows torn 
you make your way to him 
the moon becomes your silent confidant 
the one you want will stand alone 
the one you love is never known 
do you close your eyes when you kiss me 
do you close your eyes if you miss me 
and do you wonder why 
i sent for you tonight 
do you wonder why
