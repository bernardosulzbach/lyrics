Jennifer Ever

She always waits for someone
Someone who'll never leave
Reliving her decision
Her arms cover me
My couple, noone
To anyone believe
She always waits for someone
Someone, someone just like me

Jennifer always tells me
Please don't be afraid
I only want to hold you
I only want you to stay
My couple, noone
To anyone believe
She always waits for someone
Someone, someone just like me
