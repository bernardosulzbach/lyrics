There It Goes

there it goes 
playing with my heart again 
i don't know when 
i'm gonna come up for air 
for you now, again 
and the way you look at me 
makes me happy inside 
knowing all the while 
i can't hide 
come and go 
wasting my years 
i was born to fear 
that there's something in the air 
for you now, again 
for you now 
for you now 
and the way you look at me 
makes me happy inside 
knowing all the while 
i can't hide 
when you've thought to come back 
would you take me home? 
when you've thought come back 
all alone 
all alone 
there it goes 
playing with my heart again 
i don't know when 
i'm gonna come up for air 
for you now, again 
for you now 
for you now 
and the way look at me 
makes me happy inside 
knowing all the while i can't hide 
when you've thought to come back 
could you take me home? 
when you've thought to come back 
all alone 
all alone
