The Smashing Pumpkins
The Celestials

On the day that you were born
They built an empire off a scream
I cant explain
Endlessly theyll set you free
Give you reason to believe
This empty place
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
Til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Im gonna love you 101 percent
Im gonna love you til this ends
Take a chance if you should go
Face upon your happy home
The scanners wait
Selfishly they might concede
You were always on your own
You cant escape
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
Youre not me and never ever will you be
Im gonna find you and never run against
Im gonna find you til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even while their numbers call you out
Everything I want is free
Free youre free with me
Youre free with me
