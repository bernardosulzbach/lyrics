The Smashing Pumpkins
Holiday

Open up your heart 
And let your demons out 
Open up your heart 
And let your demons out 
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting for you 
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting 
Yes it's true 
Gather up your words 
And realize your worth 
Gather up your words 
And celebrate this birth 
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting for you 
I've been waiting, hesitating 
Yes it's true 
I can't throw it away 
I can't for another holiday 
I can't throw it away 
I can't for another holiday 
Open up your heart 
Open up your heart 
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting for you 
Hesitating-tating, waiting for you 
I can't throw it away 
I can't for another holiday 
I can't throw it away 
I can't for another holiday 
I can't throw it away 
I can't for another holiday 
I can't throw it away 
I can't for another holiday 
For another holiday 
For another, another holiday
