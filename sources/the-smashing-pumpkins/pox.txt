Pox

Another dumb kid
Shadow
Another restless bitch
Still fucked
Another magic trick
Hey, not a sound
Forget to forget
You're so far
you're getting close
To my heart
Of pox
Of pox
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
Another plastic squeeze
Sunkissed
Another favorite squeeze
A lost gift
We do as we please
But what with
I choose to forget
Just how close
We really are
Next to me
A pox
A pox
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
I know I'm right
I can't be wrong
Put up your dukes
You're not so strong
Every angel sleeps somewhere
Every angel dreams of sometime
Every angel walks with me now
Every angel kiss what's left upon my bruised cheek
Bazillion strong believe
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
We're giving back the dream
                                                                                                
Another dumb kid
His shadow
Another dumb kid
His shadow
Another dumb kid
His shadow
Even angels sleep sometime
