Beautiful

Beautiful  you're beautiful  as beautiful as the sun 
Wonderful  you're wonderful  as wonderful as they come 
And I can't help but feel attached 
To the feelings I can't even match 
With my face pressed up to the glass  wanting you 
Beautiful  you're beautiful  as beautiful as the sky 
Wonderful  it's wonderful  to know that you're just like I 
And I'm sure you know me well  as I'm sure you don't 
But you just can't tell 
Who'll you love and who you won't 
And I love you, as you love me 
So let the clouds roll by your face 
We'll let the world spin on to another place 
We'll climb the tallest tree above it all 
To look down on you and me and them 
And I'm sure you know me well, as I'm sure you don't 
But you just can't tell, who you'll love and who you won't 
Don't let your life wrap up around you 
Don't forget to call, whenever 
I'll be here just waiting for you 
I'll be under your stars forever 
Neither here nor there just right beside you 
I'll be under the stairs forever 
Neither here nor there just right beside you
