The Smashing Pumpkins
C'mon

Yeah, yeah, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, c'mon
Peel away the skin
Wondering what you'll see
Yeah, yeah, c'mon
When you feel it, real slow
And you're reelin' from the show
When you're reachin' from the floor
Then you're seein' you at the door
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, c'mon
I can't find the day
Wondering who I'll be
When you feel it, real slow
And you're reelin' from the show
Ain't lookin' for trouble, ain't lookin' to see
Just want a motherfucker like you and me
C'mon
Yeah!
Yeah!
