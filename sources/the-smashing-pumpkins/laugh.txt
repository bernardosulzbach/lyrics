Laugh

If they didn't know you then
What makes you think they'll know you now
Vengeance is swift and sweet and sure
Insecure
Do you laugh
Could you laugh about it
I know that
I could live without it all
You will grow to love me
Even if it kills me
Do you laugh 
And I will speak of solace
And invest in promise
Promise not to get too deep
Promised I'd never grow weak
But a soldier never comes home
Battle rages on and on
Do you laugh
Could you laugh about it
I know that
I will live without it all
I will live without it all
I often see that empty bowl
Destination still unknown
Disappearing 'round the bend
'cause the end is never the end
Do you laugh
Could you laugh about it
I know that
I could live without it all
I could live without it all
Do you laugh
Do you laugh
Do you laugh
