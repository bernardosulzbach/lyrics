Bleed

it's all i wanted 
it's all i could see 
you can watch me bleed 
settle your belief inside of me 
take someone beside you 
realize this ain't your love to break 
and the someone beside you 
settle your belief inside of me, me 
feeling in your heart 
was more than i could see here 
it's all i wanted 
it's all i could see 
you can watch me bleed 
settle your belief inside of me, me 
feeling in your heart 
was more than i could see, here 
feeling in your heart 
was more than i could see 
one and two is three 
would you should you could you cut me down down 
would you should you could you cut me down down 
down down 
would you should you could you cut me down down 
down down down 
down down 
down down
