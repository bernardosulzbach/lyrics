The Smashing Pumpkins
Cross

Climb across a sea-filled cross
See your mind as it's falling
Do you know where you've been
When you hide your old feelings
I let down, and I am falling
Time lives on, this distance calling
This distance calling
This distance calling
May you run, run away
By the sun, lead the warm, you are falling
I let fall, 'cause I am falling
Time lives on, this distance calling
This distance calling
This distance calling
