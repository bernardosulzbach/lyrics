I'm Free

I’m free, I am free 
And freedom tastes of reality 
I’m free, I am free 
And I’m waiting for you to follow me 
If I told you what it takes to reach the highest high 
You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple' 
But you've been told many times before 
Messiahs pointed to the door 
And no one had the guts to leave the temple 
I’m free, I am free 
And freedom tastes of reality 
I’m free, I am free 
And I’m waiting for you to follow me 
I’m free, I am free 
And I’m waiting for you to follow me
