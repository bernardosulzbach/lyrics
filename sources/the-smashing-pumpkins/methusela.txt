Methusela

What'd your father say to you
When he reached right through you?
Did he say the things that he had learned
From his father, too?
So when do you become your own you
Become your own you?
Or are you just a shadow of
Something whole?
We are Chinese boxes
Equal parts present and past
Where do I begin and end up?
Saw those old eyes staring right back at me
So tell me what you need
I'll be watching out for you
There are no enemies
Only dangerous friends
You grew up very fast
I didn't think I'd miss a thing
'cause nothing ever lasts
A wise old man
A wise young fool
A wise young man
A wise old fool
Try to understand
(a wise old man, a wise young fool)
(notice me, comfort me, understand me)
Just try to understand
(a wise old man, a wise young fool)
(notice me, comfort me, understand me)
What'd your father say to you
To turn you cold?
Father never quite grew up
He just grew old
And if I was to say to you
You know I love him still
Would you think less of me
For hating me?
We are Chinese boxes
Equal parts present and past
We are so unconscious
Saw those old eyes staring right back at me
So try to understand
I'm just like you, and you me
Exactly who I am
Might escape you always
The fortunes of a man
Are the debts of the son, always
A wise old man
A wise young fool
A wise young man
A wise old fool
