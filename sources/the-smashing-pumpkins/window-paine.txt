The Smashing Pumpkins
Window Paine

Window Paine around my heart 
Shadows stream around my heart 
Do what you're gonna do 
Say what you're gonna say 
Do what you're gonna do
Yeah start today 
Start today 
Wind blows shame around my heart 
Shadows scream around my heart 
What are you coming to 
Stripped down to the bone? 
Life ain't living on your own 
All alone
