If There Is a God

And if there is a God
I know he likes to rock
He likes his loud guitars
His spiders from Mars
And if there is a God 
I know he's watching me
He likes what he sees
But there's trouble on the breeze
Who are you this time?
Are you one of us, flying blind?
'Cause we're down here throwing stones
While you're so far from home
And if there is a God
And if there is a God
He's a spy with bedroom eyes
Who cowers in our skies
Who are you this time?
Are you one of us, flying blind?
'Cause we're down here throwing stones
While you're so far from home
If there is a God
If there is a God
