Cherry

(listen-want to just start it?...ready, flood?
Yeah...one, two, three, four)
Stay with me, I'll set you free
'Cause I can tell you once were pretty
Rose so sad you've lost your petals
And lost the luster of your tattle tales
I need a love to help me find my way
I need a strength that I cannot betray
I need a word to say what I can't say
I need a lover, lover
I need a lover, lover
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
Time has lost its hold on me
Hatred sleeps inside my bones 
In the stillness of cool air
All the boys have been left for dead
'Cause we know where they fear to tread
The beautiful ones, the ones we'll remember
The precious ones, our greatest pretenders
I need a love to help me find my way
I need a strength that I cannot betray
I need a word to say what I can't say
I need a lover, lover
I need a lover, lover
And if you lose yourself
Could you take me, too?
Could you rest inside the sleep?
Stay with me, I'll set you free from you
