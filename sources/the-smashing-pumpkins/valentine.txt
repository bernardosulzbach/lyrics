Valentine

Let the horses run
Your deserted mind
Catch the thread-bare strains
Of departing trains
Bound for their last goodbyes
You thought you'd think you'd know
You're sure you did your care
She was always there
For you to kick around
But now she's let you down
Now she's gone to stay
With the frost and pray
If God could hear her prayers
Would he care?
Valentine, heart of mine
Come and ease my worried mind
It's plain to see
I'm not so free
Valentine, heart of mine
And from a window
You spot her ghost
Laughing ground
And taking notes
It seems so easy
To put it down
And leave the wreckage
For someone else
Valentine, heart of mine
Take this blood
This broken vine
It's plain to see
I ain't so free
Valentine, heart of mine
You smell her hair
Everywhere you go
You see her lips
When you're leaving notes
Oh, Valentine
She never wrote
Leaves you cold
To have and hold
Valentine, heart of mine
Come and ease my worried mind
It's plain to see
I'm not so free
Valentine, heart of mine
