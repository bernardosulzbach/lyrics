Smiley

Smiley, where have you been?
Smiley, it's such a sin to say
You'll dream your life away 
No one met him, couldn't make it on a bended knee
All his friends were simple prophets only if he please
And he'll wait on his knee
Smiley, where have you been?
Smiley, it's such a sin to say
You'll dream your life away
Your love won't change
Come back to stay
Smiley Smiley Smiley Smiley
Smiley Smiley Smiley Smiley
And you- if I'm smilin'
Then I'm tryin'
'Cause I'm smilin'
