What If?

What if the sun refused to shine?
What if the clouds refused to rain?
What if the trees grew straight on down?
What if the wind refused to blow?
What if the world refused to turn?
What if the seas refused to wave?
What if? What if? What if?
I don't know, I don't care
What if? What if? What if?
I know it isn't fair, just as long as you are always there
What if we all just showed up late?
What if the clocks would hesitate?
What if we all just put it down?
What if we all just got it right?
What if? What if? What if?
I don't know, I don't care
Just as long as you are always there
What if? What if? What if?
I know it isn't fair
It came in from your sleep, 
and logged in vision,
went open your weeks,
you're lost in your mission
What if we all just lost our minds?
What if the birds just chose to walk?
What if Fellini wanted to sing?
What if we all just moved to Rome?
What if? What if? What if?
I don't know, I don't care
What if? What if? What if?
I know it isn't fair, just as long as you are always there
As long as you are there,
I know it isn't fair
As long as you are there,
I know and I don't care
