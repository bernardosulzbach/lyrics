everywhere you are 
and everywhere you've been 
no matter how far 
if you're hanging on a star 
and don't know what to do 
you don't know where to fall 
no matter where you are 
i'm everywhere you are 
your love must always be true 
your love must always be true 
it's everywhere you are 
it's everywhere you are 
the storm don't need you 
it's everywhere you are 
it's everywhere you are 
the storm don't need you 
and in your mind 
you were alone 
all this time 
and everything you are 
and everything you saw 
still locked in your heart 
and everywhere you are 
it's everywhere you are 
it's everywhere you are 
the storm don't need you 
eat your piece 
of cosmic cake 
make the change 
it's not too late 
celebrate 
change color blue 
into my veins 
i will see 
everywhere you are 
and everywhere you go 
we're walking the same mile 
and don't know where to go 
even if you crawl 
no matter how far 
it's everywhere you are 
it's everywhere you are 
your love must always be true 
your love must always 
your love must always be true 
everywhere you are 
everywhere you are 
everywhere you are 
it's everywhere you are
