and i saw right through 
and though i knew 
you know it suits me well 
i wait for you 
i dream about you 
you know it suits me well 
bound by your leaving 
i'd since forgotten 
i knew it then 
but then i closed my mind 
to the truth, the awful 
the awful words 
you know my hands are tied 
bound by your leaving 
you know my hands are tied 
wishing you were by my side 
you know it suits me well 
bound by your leaving 
you know my hands are tied 
wishing you were by my side 
well it seems to show 
only when i'm alone 
all alone 
only when i'm all alone 
it suits me well
