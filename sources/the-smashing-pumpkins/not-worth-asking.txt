Not Worth Asking

Not worth asking, who I'm supposed to be
Not worth saying, seems I'm free
Not worth reaching, to anyone at all
Not worth reaching out to stop this fall
I'm on my own
Yeah, I'm on my own 
Not worth being, I might already be
I just want someone to reach for me
Not worth sinkin', it's not worth diggin' down
I've been here before, and hate what I've found 
It's too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away
It's too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away, so far away 
Not worth asking, who I'm supposed to be
Not worth saying something, seems I'm free
Not worth reaching to anyone at all
Not worth reaching out, I'll stop this fall 
But I like you just the same
You've got to know some how
That I'm the one to blame
We've come so far along
To end this destiny
You've got to know somehow 
That it's too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away
Yeah, it's too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away, so far away
