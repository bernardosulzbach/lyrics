Rotten Apples

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Where the cool winds blow I must surely go
For my love calls me lo to drag her from the depths of my soul
When will I see her again?
The other side of friends
The darkened clouds of death
The empty-breathed desire
Dirty you face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when you love goes unrequited
Restless in my speech
And ruthless in my teach
So vacant in my breach
I drive the dirt of her garden
Sorrow
She'll never listen again
No other lovers to bend
Just rotten apples to eat
Slathered yellow distant scorn
Dirty you face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when you love goes unrequited
Life just fades away
Purity just begs
Dust to dust we're wired into sadness
