My Eternity

I've been here before
And I don't know where I go
???
And something tells me
I don't know
Without you
Laying on the floor
Turning back a life that's pure
I've been here before
And something tells me
I don't know
Without you
You beg
My eternity alone
I've been here before
And I don't know where I go
-
And something tells me
I don't know
Without you
Standing there
Done before
I don't know
And something tells me
I don't know
Without you
You'll yield
And I pray
To be
And I pray
To be
My eternity alone
Alone
My eternity
Alone
And I pray
To be
My eternity alone
Alone
And I pray
To be
My eternity alone
Alone
My eternity
Alone
