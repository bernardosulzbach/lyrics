The Sacred and Profane

Give me tears  give me love 
Let me rest  Lord above 
Send the bored  your restless 
The feedback scarred  devotionless 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Just in time to prove 
Will our words ever be enough? 
Just in time to lose 
Give me sight and barren breast 
Pure snow and happiness 
Give me time, give me peace 
And I will prove my release 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
Trapped in the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Just in time to prove 
Will our time ever be enough? 
Will our love ever be enough? 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Just in time to prove
