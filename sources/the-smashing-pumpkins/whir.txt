Whir

i wasted all my years
been chasing all my fears
from another, brighter than you
i gave in long ago
to make it to the show
it's not easy
when you're alone
all your prayers
in my ears
don't you care
whir yourself around
just to fall back down
whir yourself around
my honey, little girl
come on let's go for a whirl
it's the early sign of sleep
she says she wants to marry me
she says she wants a baby
it's not easy
when you're scared
whir yourself around
just to fall back down
whir yourself around
all your prayers
in my ears
don't you care
