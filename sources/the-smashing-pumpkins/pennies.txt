And I stumbled onto you
As you stumbled over me
And you say the fates were cruel
For throwing us together
I always loved you so
Especially when you'd go
All the world must know
That I loved you so
Its a pity we're apart
Its a shame you broke my heart
But I've got a new girlfriend
She looks a lot like you dear
No one could ever do dear
All the world must know
That I loved you so
Especially when you'd go
Especially when you'd go away and leave me here
Go away and leave me alone
All the world must know
