The Smashing Pumpkins
Cottonwood Symphony

When they chop down this tree
I won't be around, no
When they come after me
I won't be found, no
No no, oh no
There's no more failure to erase, oh no
With fingerprints upon a glass
Lazy river winds
Forever roaming far
The sunsets out of reach
The skies I've longed to touch
Lazy river roam
Of cottonwood symphony
Unlock the box
The key is yours
The treasures you forgot
Are well-preserved
Lazy river roam
When they take
Shake for grace
Trouble thee no more
Can't this love
Without room
Be considered home, no
No no, no no
No Cleopatra to escape, oh no
With trinkets found along the road
Flow river flow
Forever roaming far
The sunsets out of reach
The skies I've longed to touch
Lazy river roam
Of cottonwood symphony
