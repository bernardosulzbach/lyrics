Dorian, Dorian
What have you done?
Dorian
As you run, a setting sun
Dorian
A setting sun, it finds you
Is it always as you want?
Is it always as you thought?
Dorian
What have you done?
Dorian
Oh my child, when our number's up and done
It's what they taught
Dorian
As you run, a setting sun
Dorian
A fleeting dream, it finds you
Is it always as you thought?
Is it always as you want?
Dorian
What have you done?
Dorian
A setting sun
Dorian 
Whoever finds you, whoever finds you
