The Smashing Pumpkins
Satellites

Me and her
We get around
Never see much
Staring hard
Into the ground
Electricity for love
You know it's the end of all
You know this is the end
It's what you've been waiting for
Like a long lost friend
Attached by satellites...
It's a long way down
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
Me and her
We get around
We always rock the bus
Each a tube
Inside the ground
Electricity for love
You know this is the end
You know it's the end
It's what you've been waiting for
Like a long lost friend
Attached by satellites...

You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
You're an angel
I don't wanna go to heaven
