Be yourself, don't be
yourself
Speak your mind, don't speak your mind
Stand alone, don't stand alone
Be on your own, be
all alone
And as the bells ring the graces
Of a
newborn day
The voices sing the praises
Of your
promised youth, promised whenever
And no one can see
you
So do what you want to
You're invisible next
to forever
Be yourself, don't be yourself
Speak your mind, don't speak your mind
Stand alone,
don't stand alone
Be on your own, be all alone
Take some time to thank the souls
For all their
emptiness
Upon the fever dreams of distant sons
And
daughters dressed for ransoms, for never
And nobody
knows you
Even if they pretend to
They all sure that
they're just as clever
Truth is rare as ivory
The
truth is in their pure deceit
Blessed in your naivete
Ooh, i thank you all
Ooh, i thank you all
Ooh,
i thank you all, i do
Ooh, i thank you all
