I lie I wait I stop I hesitate I am. 
I see I melt I think of me. 
Is it any wonder I can't sleep. 
All I have is all you gave to me. 
IS it any wonder I found peace. 
Through you. 
Turn to the gates of heaven turn myself around(around). 
Turn away from I. 
Its not enough. 
Just a touch. It's not enough. 
I taste. 
I Love I can I bleed I love  
I hate I'm now I was I want too much 
Is it any wonder I can't sleep, all  
Have is all yo gave to me is it any wonder I found peace. 
Through you. Turn to the gates of heaven to myself be damned turn away from I. 
It's not enough. Just a touch. It's not enough. 
Just a touch. Its not enough. Just a touch. 
It's not enough. Just a touch. Its not enough. Just a touch. Its not enough. 
Just a touch...
