Autumn Nocturne

rollin with the breeze 
do what you please 
I guess you'd say 
we'll take the whole day 
skip out of school 
run around and act like 
the fools that we are 
ain't gonna do anyone any harm 
train whistle at our backs 
laid our pennies down the tracks 
forget our cares 
I guess you'd say 
we'll take the whole day 
go for a swim 
dry off in the wind 
the sun's goin' down so we better get back 
it's too easy to stay 
so lazy, hazy, maybe crazy 
rollin' with the breeze 
do what you please 
so take it easy, yes, please 
strollin' with the leaves
