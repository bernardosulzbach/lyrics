You say I'm beautiful
Well I can't help it
You say I'm empty
We all know I'm full of shit
Get out, get out
You've lost control
Get out, get out
You're growing cold
Can anyone, anyone be true?
Does anyone, anyone want to be you?
You say I'm tragic
I say it's magic, kid
You say I'm lucky
We all know it's in the cards
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
You've lost control
Can anyone, anyone be true?
Does anyone, anyone want to be you?
Do they want to be you?
Bring it, Jimmy
Floating
Knocked out, sky high, floating
Flat out, deadly truth
Does anyone want to be you?
Can anyone, anyone be true?
Does anyone, anyone want to be you?
Do they want to be you?
