order, radio
sister wishing i'm alone
a thousand miles of desolation
open eyed appreciation
on your radio
i will surround you
slinking in your skin
i control your mind
we'll grab your hand
three six five
take what is real
rip it up, see how you feel
a thousand miles of desolation
open eyed appreciation
on your radio
i will surround you
in a skin
(?)
three six five
what on earth
i say you think
what on earth
i say you think
see me sell
i feel
i'll forget
three six five
come on down
three six five
