Taking my time
Taking everything I have
Losing my mind
Losing everything I have
Who do you want to be?
You want satisfaction you can't receive
Who do you want to be?
You want satisfaction you can't receive
Harder to find
Easy to just walk away
Losing my mind
Lost everything I had
That I had
That I had
That I had
Who do you want to be?
You want satisfaction you can't receive
How many times will you leave?
You want sati-satisfaction you can't receive
