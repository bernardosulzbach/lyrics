The Smashing Pumpkins
Go

the slowest night
the slowest dance
you sway across the room as you dream
an empty house
with empty rooms
I loved you so
and now you're going
go, and leave if you must know
and go, I never wanted you to know
go
we ran away
or so we thought
now I know you were told to
go
to know love
to show love
and go
to give love
to feel loved
and go
I fell asleep
washed up on the shore
I kiss my [son Christopher?]
you move to speak
no words could reach me
at one, once knew
go, love, and learn by your desire
and know love
you're the only reason why
I'm terrified to go
to know love
to show love
go [go]
to give love
to feel loved
go [go]
to know love
to show love
I'm begging you to go
