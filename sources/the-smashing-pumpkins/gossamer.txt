you will fly away again
you will
straight into the heart of the sun
straight into the heart of everyone
you will break my heart against
my will
I will be dead out of a gun
I will be dead out of everyone
fly, fly away when you say you won't
you follow when you swear you just don't
I can't rule you no more
we'll buy you another sun
we'll buy you another sun to love
we'll buy you another sun
we'll buy you another sun
go find you another sun to gun down
go find you
another sun
you don't want me anymore
you don't love me anymore
no more
(uli john roth solo)
you will fly away again you will
you will fly away again you will
bleed into the heart of the sun
you will break my heart against my will
you will break my heart against my will
love bleeding out of your gun
