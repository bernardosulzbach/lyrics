Suffer

All that you suffer is all that you are 
All that you smother is all that you are 
And you're seeing, you're seeing, you're seeing who you are 
What takes meaning is cleaning the meaning of who you are 
On this seam 
I will dream 
On this seam 
All of your struggles beneath your disguise 
Drink from the reasons that hold you alive 
To ascend from the wounds of desire and pain 
You must rise from the bounds of desire and shame
Too late to discover peace of mind 
Too late to recover me 
All you see and all you breathe and all you cease to be 
Taking down your only son and what he means to me 
Your dream will be 
To dream with me 
Will you wait? Yes I'll wait, I will wait for you 
To cleanse your life takes more than time 
Take what you want 
Take all of me 
Too late to discover peace of mind 
I've no peace of mind 
Too late to recover
