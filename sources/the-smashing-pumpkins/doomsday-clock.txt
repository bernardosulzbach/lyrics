Doomsday Clock

Is everyone afraid?
Is everyone ashamed?
They're running towards their holes to find out
Apocalyptic thieves
Are lost amongst our dead
A message to our friends, to get out
There's wagers on this fear
Oh, oh, so clear
Depends on what you'll pay to hear
They're bound to kill us all
In white-washed halls
The jackals lick their paws
Please don't stop
It's lonely at the top
These lonely days
Will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock
Tickin' in my heart, not broken
I love life everyday, each and every way
Kafka would be proud to find out
I'm certain of the end; it's the means that has me spooked
It takes an unknown truth to get out
I guess that I'm born free, c'est la vi
I was meant to beg from my knees
Please, don't stop
It's lonely at the top
These lonely days
Will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock
Tickin' in my heart
These lonely days, will they ever stop?
Gotta dig in
Gas mask's on
Wait in the sunshine overhead
If this is living, sakes alive
Well, then, we can't win, no one survives
Is everyone afraid?
You should be ashamed
Apocalyptic screams mean nothing to the dead
Kiss your little son to know all there is
C'mon, last call!
You should want it all!
It's lonely at the top
These lonely days, will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock
These lonely days, will they ever stop?
It's tickin' in my heart
Is everyone afraid?
