Rise Against
The Strength to Go On

Welcome home
While away
They have tampered with the locks
And your things they rearranged
"We propose,
A better way"
Said the note they left behind
In their wake of disarray
You fell in place
Don't fall asleep
They'll find us here
I know a place
To disappear
As a voice proclaimed
[Chorus]
What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'till the day we die
Or 'till we don't have the strength to go on
'Till we don't have the strength to go on
Let us cry
Let us be
Let us open up our hearts
Without fear of anything
Faith alone's
All we need
To traverse this burning bridge
Now before it gets too late
You claim, "it's fine"
But the heart reveals
What smiles betray
Your sad sad eyes
Gave you away
And don't you know
[Chorus]
Our shoulders bear an awful weight
But still we trudge on just the same
Our colors run then leave a stain
They blacken our once honest name
How can we argue, tell me
Over the fury and the fire
How many times can we tell you that we
Are not like you, we see right through
The poor disguise that fails to fool
The wary eye is trained on you
[Chorus: x2]
Yeah we don't have the strength to go on.
