Bring Me the Horizon
Liquor and Love Lost

I thought I saw your eyes,
Laced in smoke and cigarette curls,
I thought I saw your eyes,
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight,
She haunts me,
Till my bitter end,
She haunts me,
I swear I heard your voice,
Overwhelmed by conversation,
I swear I heard your voice,
But I'm hearing ghosts,
Tonight, the bars turn out their lights,
And I drink away the day as it decays,
So much for living forever,
So much for death do us part,
She haunts me,
She haunts me,
She haunts me every fucking night,
