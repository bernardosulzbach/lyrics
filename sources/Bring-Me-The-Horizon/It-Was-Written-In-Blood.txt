Bring Me the Horizon
It Was Written In Blood

Goodbye my friend, goodbye
My love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
We're united by and by, united by and by
Goodbye
No handshake to endure, there was nothing
[Chorus]
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh god, written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood
Inside no sadness, for a prowl
As nothing new lay dying now
Inside no sadness, for a prowl
And nothing new lay dying now
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god!
It was written, in blood
On a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses
We've fallen apart, fallen apart
It was written in blood
On a fucking suicide note
The night before he died
[Chorus]
Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
Fallen apart
We've fallen
These roses, white roses
Roses
My roses
White roses
