Bring Me the Horizon
Don't Look Down

Don't look down!
Let's go!
You'll never take me
You'll never win
If I'm going down,
You're coming with me.
I'll never shut down,
I'll never sleep.
If I'm going down,
I'll take the world with me.
Yo,
The Devil's at your door,
You sold your soul,
Now he's coming back for more.
No fighting it, it will only make it worse.
You signed the line,
You said the words.
Get ready for the end of everything.
(Don't look down!)
Get ready for the end of everything.
(Don't look down!)
The Devil's at your door.
(The Devil's at your door)
You sold your soul,
Now he's coming back for more.
Don't fight, it'll only make it worse.
You signed the line,
You said the words.
Get ready for the end of everything.
Get ready for the end of everything.
What have you done?
You've opened it now.
And I'm not sure there's anyway round.
Why do you run?
It's tripping me out.
And I don't know if I can keep up with you now.
The sky is falling,
The sun is burning,
A hole into our eyes.
The ground will open
Like an ocean,
And swallow us alive.
You say you swear to God,
Now swear to me!
You say you swear to God,
Now swear to me!
