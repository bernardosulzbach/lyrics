Bring Me the Horizon
Anthem

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
Someone call an ambulance, I got wounds to attend
Someone call a doctor, I fear this is the end
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay
I hate to say I told you so, but fuck it, I told you so
Don't say a word, I already know
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
Someone call an exorcist and help me kill this curse
I can't stop the bleeding and it's only getting worse
Get the fuck up
This is it, the sound of giving in
Yeah, get the fuck up
This is it
The end of everything
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
Lost in a dream, never fell asleep
I've come back to old remedies
