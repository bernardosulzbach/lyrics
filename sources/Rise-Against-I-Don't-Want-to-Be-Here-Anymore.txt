Rise Against
I Don't Want to Be Here Anymore

On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings at someone's back and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere this fate, I lost control
We backed down, we took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around
I don't want to be here anymore 
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured, whoa whoa
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn 
And I don't want to be here anymore
On hand and foot we answered every single call
Weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone
Won't back down, won't take no for answers anymore
These walls close, we pace back and forth
I don't want to be here anymore 
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured, whoa whoa
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn 
I don't want to be here anymore
The point where we break is closer everyday
But where do we go? But where do we go?
I don't want to be here anymore 
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured, whoa whoa
See I don't think I can fight this anymore, 
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn 
And I don't want to be here anymore
Anymore
