Rise Against
Awake Too Long

I watched the rise and the fall of the common man
I lived to see your steps walk back
I watched the walls all crash down, crumbling
Just to be rebuilt while we slipped
We threw suds in the oceans winding
We promised peace but the peace won’t last
‘Cause now we forged new brakes so nervously
Waiting for this harmony to pass
I stand guard and roam
Like a sentinel
I see it all
I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something that could close my eyes
To all that I see
Awake too long
It would be easier to fall asleep
We fell in love but the love kept running out
We follow roads but the roads all end
We lived and learned, and learned to live without
Falling from the matters we assemble
I’ve seen the eyes of the widows left behind
I’ve seen the child of a violent man
And never once did our leaders apologize
For battles they began
I can’t look away, or pretend not to see
And so I say
I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something that could close my eyes
To all that I see
Awake too long
It would be easier to fall asleep
Asleep
Maybe I would dream if I could sleep
Maybe I’d see what this could be
Instead of what you know
And is there bliss in ignorance?
Is this our demise we can’t prevent?
Should we fall asleep?
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
(I’ve been awake too long) And like constant vigils we all
(I’ve been awake too long) Carry eternal flames
(I’ve been awake too long) I’m saturate pains to an open heart
(I’ve been awake too long) But through it all
Every single cut I’ve been awake
