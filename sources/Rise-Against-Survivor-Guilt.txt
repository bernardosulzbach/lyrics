Rise Against
Survivor Guilt

Block the entrances
Close the door
Seal the exits
Because this is war
All gave some
Some gave all
But for what
I want to know
[Chorus]
Carry on
Don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve
A folded flag
A purple heart
A family all but torn apart
I fought with courage to preserve
Not my way of life, but yours
[Chorus]
The cowards preach from pedestals
With words and courage and resolve
But one thing that'll fuck 'em all
'Cause is freedom isn't free
They send our daughters and our sons
To deserts under burning suns
A sacrificial slaughter to fill
The pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy
Are we so easily deceived?
Come, carry on
Just walk away
How many more sent to their graves
In this lesson ignored?
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
What purpose did I serve?
