Rise Against
Satellite

You can't feel the heat until you hold your hand over the flame
You have to cross the line just to remember where it lays
You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it
That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
'Cause these are the things we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why you stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're perspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American dreams
Oh shine your light on me
You can't fill your cup until you empty your lit house
You can't understand what lays ahead
If you don't understand the past
You'll never learn the fun now
Till you're standing at the cliff
And you cant truly love until you've given up on it
She told me that she never would face the world again
So I offer up a plan
We'll sneak out when they sleep
And sail off in the night.
We'll come clean and start over the rest of our lives.
When we're gone we'll stay gone.
Out of sight, out of mind.
It's not too late,
We have the rest of our lives.
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off into the night
We'll come clean and start over the rest of our lives
Out of sight, out of mind.
It's not too late,
We have the rest of our lives.
The rest of our lives
The rest of our lives
Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah 'cause these are the things we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why you stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're perspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American dreams
Oh shine your light on me
Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah 'cause these are the things we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
'Cause these are the things that we can't deny now
This is a life that you can't deny us now
