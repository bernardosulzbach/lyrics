Rise Against
The Eco-Terrorist in Me

Stagnate the cameras, dim the flagrancy,
Want to kill, just got the life in me,
Hold their vendettas without an enemy,
You can't defy us, any way you please!
You make the rules, we make the calls
My conscience clean, my systems hold
Because I found God (hey!)
In the sound of your factories burning down,
Now I sleep so sound
When it all comes down, 
Will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, 
Can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let it go?
It said, do what is right, they build higher walls
Where we can't shed a light, on true criminals
When business and suffering are one and the same
We lost all the people, they turned to the flame
I found love (love!)
I found life (life!)
As a thorn stuck in your side,
And you wonder why
When it all comes down, 
Will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, 
Can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by, to watch it fall away?
Will you hold up? (Will you hold up?) 
did you hold up? 
Or just let it burn?
Did you let it burn?
When it all comes down, 
Will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, 
Can you say that you never gave up?
When it all comes down, 
Will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down,
When it all comes down
When the lights all blow out, 
And roadblocks blow up,
When you sleep to the sound of alarms going off
When it all comes down, 
Will you say you did everything you could?
