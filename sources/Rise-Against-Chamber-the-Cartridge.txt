Rise Against
Chamber the Cartridge

Tell me how these things traced with colors filled with black debris
And how these loyal, living Reich were nameless things swept out of sight
Dead through the streamers on the sky past neon words where we
Remember those killed by names we each call, are you happy where you are?
Blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry our weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial
Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine
Let's go!
And so we carry on each day as if our lives were not so real
While every breath that we take, we only suffocate
First bouts of delirium and scenes of homeless Democrats
On Wall Street, a single mom of three, a TV personality
I'm blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry their weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But they all live in denial
Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've begun?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine
Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine
