Rise Against
The First Drop

I'm calling out
Only echoes respond
But I scream 'til my voice is gone
Crouching in corners and hiding your face
I'm sick and tired of playing your games
I'm not alone
I stand amongst the voiceless
Millions in the unforgiving sun
Here arm-in-arm
We parade these streets
And sing our songs (and sing our songs)
We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)
Unknowing, we lie and wait for the rain
To wash away what they have made
Face down in the dirt with your foot on my back
In the distance I hear thunder crack
C'mon stand up!
This system of power and privilege is about to come to an end
Here come the clouds
The first drop is falling down (falling down)
We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)
Our futures burn in red horizons
Ashes scattered in winds of change
Casualty numbers are rising
Now it's time to raise the stakes
We're meant for something more than living just to put food on our plates
I can't help but wonder--why should we participate?
We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)
