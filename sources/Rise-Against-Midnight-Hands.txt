Rise Against
Midnight Hands

Like a new day rising, like a calm before the storm
Like fog lifting from valleys on a sleeping forest floor
Eyes open slowly as the dust is shaken off
To gaze upon the wreckage that the midnight hands have brought.
And now I
I feel my temperature rising.
My body explodes.
I feel like somebody's watching, like I'm not alone,
I stopped I
Vowed right then and said that,
Whatever path you take, wherever you might go, 
Whenever you decide to leave, 
I will follow, I will follow.
We face a crossroad never knowing what's in store.
There's an angel on my shoulder,
There's a devil at my door
She proclaimed tonight will be the greatest of our lives
And I said don't be so sure let's just wait until the morning light.
I feel my temperature rising.
My body explodes.
I feel like somebody's watching, like I'm not alone,
I stopped I
Vowed right then and said that,
Whatever path you take, wherever you might go, 
Whenever you decide to leave, 
I will follow, I will follow.
There in the clearing, we gathered close
Under the moon's pale light we laid out the tools.
"And you don't have to do this, and I'd forgive you if you don't"
But she just looked away and said "I know"
Gripped by the midnight hands We dream of futures that would prevent
Gripped by the midnight hands
The line's crossed over
The dawn grows closer
Let's bite off too much
Let's jump with a blind trust
In water over our head
And whatever path you take, and wherever you might go, 
And whenever you decide to leave, 
I will follow, I will follow, I will
Bear all falls you take, I won't let go if you decided to stray
I'll be there until you don't wake up, yeah, I will follow, I will follow
I will follow
(whatever path you take)
I will follow
(wherever you might go, I will follow)
I will follow
(whenever you decide to leave)
I will follow.
