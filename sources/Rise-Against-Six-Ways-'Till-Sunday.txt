Rise Against
Six Ways 'Till Sunday

the years unfold in one moment
the voices that we heard so loud
are now suddenly silenced
inside this crowd

and you're surrounded by the lives 
of those who found something to hold 
so bringing everybody down 
is all you know 

you've been hiding so long 
you can't find yourself 
in this sheltered life you live
when everything you want is at your fingertips
you'll never know what need is 

you're claiming to be something different 
so wanting to believe
that you're better than the rest
to make up for your self-esteem 
you talk to hear your own voice and 
you've left me no choice but to choose 
I miss the person that you were 
but I don't miss you 

you're the new revolution
the angst-filled adolescent 
you fit the stereotype well
