Bring Me the Horizon
Off The Heezay

I've been taken from your arms so many times,
I've felt this before,
The sheets are tangled, 
And they don't feel right on my carcass like you do,
This is my revenge, 
And this is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
(Gin-gin-gin)
I feel dead, I feel dead inside,
I feel dead, I feel so fucking dead,
I feel dead,
I, feel so dead,
Last night, we dressed to our best,
And drank till there was nothing left,
I walked you home, you held my hand,
We fucked away the rest of the night,
Take my hand,
For this is my revenge,
This is your demise,
For every second lost,
I
This is my revenge, 
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my
This is my revenge,
This is my
(For every second sleep has stole)
And sweetie, I've got to say,
That I'm really not worth the time of your day,
I guess when we left each other for the first time,
We didn't think "goodbye" would be our new favorite line
