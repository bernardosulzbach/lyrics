Bring Me the Horizon
Football Season Is Over

why the fuck can i not hail a taxi?
arm out like a nazi - every cunt's driving past
where the fuck is everyone?
i can't see anyone. i can't see anything!
the hardest part of today is a hangover
empty bottles and empty promises
i got every person i need
and it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night. I can't remember anything!
"Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs"
We are done with giving a fuck.
