Bring Me the Horizon
The Fear That Gave Me Wings

My eyes are shut for now it seems the only way that I can cope. 
A glittering example of what we've become. 
So grab yourself by the wrist and think about this twice 
One mistake could be the last action that you make. 
Now I'm on m knees, I can feel my spirit leaving me. 
I chose to promise myself that I'd never let you down. 
To capture this moment would be the best idea yet. 
Cowering in the dark. This room is now my friend. 
I'll stay here and wait it out until the pressure ends. 
I can't wait!!! Everything around me is a test to see I can last. 
I don't know if I can. Where's my strength at? 
I made a promise to myself that I'd always be around. 
I should capture this moment, before I let you down. 
I'm sure that I'll be heard, 
I've got too much to lose to fly away and leave all of this behind. 
So capture this moment, before I forget why I'm here. 
I'm killing the only person in life I thought I knew. 
The only person left to blame for this is you! 
I've got things to say that I know you want to hear. 
I can see through you perfectly clear. 
Don't go too far. I chose to stay here. Remind me where we are.
