Bring Me the Horizon
Home Sweet Hole

Cross my heart I don't want to die
But Heaven knows it seems like I try
Lost in a labyrinth for weeks on end
I live and I learn from my mistakes
Then forget them again
Got a feeling in my stomach and it just won't quit
As subtle as a shotgun and as heavy as a brick
Cause I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is
He's a lot more familiar than I care to admit
If only I could focus
Maybe if I could see
If I didn't know any better
I would say he looks just like me
The roof is crashing down
The walls are caving in
We've discovered all your stories
Are just works of fiction
The roof is crashing down
The truth is spilling out
Oh shit
I've done it again
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh)
I've crossed the line
(No)
So many times
I don't even know what it stands for
Oh shit
I've done it again
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh)
I've crossed the line
(No)
So many times
I don't even know what it stands for
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you say
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you say
Got a feeling in my stomach that just won't quit
As subtle as a shotgun as heavy as a brick
Bite your tongue just bite your tongue
You've already said quite enough
The roof is crashing down
The walls are caving in
We discover all your stories
Are just works of fiction
The roof is crashing down
The truth is spilling out
Oh shit I've done it again:
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh)
I've crossed the line
(No)
So many times
I don't even know what it stands for
Oh shit I've done it again:
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh)
I've crossed the line
(No)
So many times
I don't even know what it stands for
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair and let's be done with it
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair so kick the chair
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair and let's be done with it
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair so kick the chair
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you say
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home Sweet Hole
Just be careful what you say
