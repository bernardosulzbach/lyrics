Rise Against
Survive

Somewhere between happy, and  total fucking wreck
Feet sometimes on solid ground, sometimes at the edge
To spend your waking moments, simply counting time
Is to give up on your hopes and dreams, give up on your?
[Chorus]
Life for you, has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive, is what makes us who we are
An obvious disinterest, a barely managed smile
I'll take a deep nod in agreement, a status quo exile
I shirk my obligations, I miss all your deadlines
I'm excel at quitting early, you're fucking up my life
[Chorus]
All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out, I have never felt so fucking great
All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out, I have never felt so great
(Life isn't like this) [Repeat x4]
Life isn't like this [Repeat x2] (Life isn't like this) [Repeat x3]
Are we verging on an answer, fucking up my?
[Chorus]
(Who we are)
It's what makes us who we are
(Who we are)
Makes us who we are
(Who we are)
It's what makes us who we are
(Who we are)
