Rise Against
Reception Fades

You talk about the way things were
But I can't hear what you're saying
A time when life was not this hard
Blessed by the innocence
Is the best yet to come?
Or did it pass by long ago?
Are we holding on to a thread
Of something already dead?
I'm not your reason to stand up straight
Shoulders back chest out and eyes raised
Stepping back, I hesitate
I can't let myself be taken
The reception fades, the signals breaking up
And am I moving on or am I giving up?
If you walk away from this with anything
Live your life today
