Rise Against
Join The Ranks

With your eyes glazed and half-smile
Explain to me the details of your God-given right
You point your finger in my face
But you can't remember what you did last night
It's all fun and games ?til you try to justify
It's all fun and done ?til you question the choices in your life
Join all the millions of victims who prescribe to this mediocre life
And all these years have been lost looking for something that you'll never find
It's all fun and games ?til you try to justify
It's all fun and done ?til you question the choices in your life
