Rise Against
Under The Knife

Wake me up inside, tell me there's a reason, to take another step 
To get up off my knees and follow this path of most resistance 
Whatever it takes us, whatever it faces and where ever it leads 
So wake me when it's through 
I don't want to feel the things that you do 
Don't worry I'll be fine, I just don't want this dream 
Wake me up inside 
Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling 
Though we look awake, inside we're all still sleeping 
And I spend my time here alive but barely there 
Do you believe we'll ever make it, do you think we'll ever really see 
So wake me when it's through 
I don't want to feel the things that you do 
Don't worry I'll be fine, I just don't want this dream 
Wake me up inside 
Wake me up inside, these dreams all die if we let them 
Wake me up inside, today won't start if we just give in 
Don't show me anything 
Just wake me when it's through 
I don't want to feel the things that you do 
Don't worry I'll be fine 
I just don't want this dream 
Wake me up inside
