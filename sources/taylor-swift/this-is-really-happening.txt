This Is Really Happening

Beneath the chandelier of star and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows open up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It’s like I’m melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move 
and
Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
that I'm not crazy
and this is really happening 
That this is really happening
Could this be better?
You write me letters 
though you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights 
It really blows me away 
Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can’t take my eyes off you 
Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
and I'm not crazy and
This is really happening 
That this is really happening
All those kisses up against your car 
For all those wishes on planes 
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs 
Oh baby, here we are
Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
and I'm not crazy and
Oh and this is really happening 
That this is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby 
Tell me 
You'll always need me 
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening
Tell me, Oh
You'll always need me 
(need me ,tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening
