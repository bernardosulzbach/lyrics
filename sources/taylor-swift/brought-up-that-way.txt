Taylor Swift
Brought Up That Way

Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please don't make me go back there again."
She said, "I wish there was someway to make them stop it."
So he drives down to that principles office
And says, "I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I'd live my whole damn life to see that little girl smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said, "I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I'd live my whole damn life to see my little girl smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way."
The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's Officer Tate"
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
You'd better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily she's fading fast."
He says, "God I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her  down
Nearly killed me the day they put her mama in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girls smile
So please don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today, she wasn't brought up that way."
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes
