Taylor Swift
Nevermind

Look at you
Look at me
Look at who
We could be
I wanna know
Who you are
What you want
From the start
And everytime I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you
And everytime you look at me 
I could go crazy but I don't 
say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone 
Than lose you
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, nevermind
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do baby
To make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
Now think of who
We could be
And everytime I look at you 
I can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you
And everytime you look at me I could go crazy 
but I don't say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone 
Than lose you
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, nevermind
All I really wanna say is I need you babe
But how could you understand
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you, nevermind
And I could tell you now
But baby nevermind
Yeah
Oh yeah
I could tell you now but nevermind
Yeah 
Oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but nevermind
