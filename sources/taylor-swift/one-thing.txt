Taylor Swift
One Thing

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin
Driving away and I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
There's nothing to say and I
I try to grab at the fray 'cause I, I still love you but I can't!
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah.
Picture frame is empty it's black and white
You're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
Back to the conversation we were so sure of everything
Everything we thought we'd always have.
Lost in the sound of it, the here and the now comes and
It seems like I'm becoming part of your past!
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me.
There's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends.
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me.
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah, if there was one thing I knew would never leave me...
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin.
