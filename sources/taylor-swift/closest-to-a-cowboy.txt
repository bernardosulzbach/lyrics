Taylor Swift
Closest To A Cowboy

I drive around this town in a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing for me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought that for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
'Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought that for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
It was all a bit wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look at a sunset the same like,
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
