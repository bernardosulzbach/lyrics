Taylor Swift
Writing Songs About You

I can't believe you did it again, walked by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good? 
Don't you know I'm trying to hate you?
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire when you're the one who lit it?
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.
I've got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you, baby
Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name 
Then I tear it all to shreds!
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.
And if you ever change your mind and want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in.
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay 'cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do I'll just wait for the day that I stop pretending that
I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.
