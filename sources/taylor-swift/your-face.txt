Taylor Swift
Your Face

i heard a song tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
she sees his face in every space, every room
and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
if i close my eyes will you be there?
[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
i hope i never lose that feelin'
i used to get when you called
and i wonder to myself
who were you? where are you? were you ever here at all?
[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
that girl in the song had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes and see you
i wish the sky had your face 
and the oceans has your eyes
and the sun that had your lips
and i had you, ohhhh yeah
[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
ohhh, no, no
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna turn around
oh oh oh oh, yeah
oh, oh, ohhhh
oh, oh, ohhhh
oh, oh, ohhhh yeah
