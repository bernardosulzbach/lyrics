Taylor Swift
By the Way

I had to catch my breath when I saw you there 
Across the room holding her hand
I'd never guessed starting over would be so good on you 
But here I am still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off...
By the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take me awhile to love again
So many things that I forgot to say, by the way.
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
Guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing come over here and say 
"I'm looking good."
But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take me awhile to love again
So many things that I forgot to say.
By the way you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wonder
I still have the same old number just in case.
I still miss you, and I still love you, by the way.
By the way...
