Taylor Swift
Here You Come Again

Here you come again
Just when I've begun
To get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart
Around your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about
To make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wondering
How I came to doubt you
All you got to do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messing up my mind
And filling up my senses
Here you come again
Looking better than a body
Has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
All you got to do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messing up my mind
And filling up my senses
Here you come again
Looking better than a body
Has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
Here I go
And here you come again
