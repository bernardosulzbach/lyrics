Taylor Swift
Stupid Boy

Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin 
Wrapped around my heart 
Is it like anywhere you've been? 
And everything I do I do it just for you 
So why the hell don't you love me? 
Why the hell don't you need me 
Like I need you?
Are you so far above me? 
Don't you know there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 
I have been looking in 
Tryin' to read your mind 
Give you the benefit of the doubt 
Every single time 
But didn't you walk right by 
I'm screamin' out inside 
So why the hell don't you love me? 
Why the hell don't you need me? 
Like I need you 
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 
What happens when you wake up 
And see what you've lost 
Take one look at me 'cause 
That's what it cost 
I was gonna be everything you need 
Cause you are everything to me 
So why the hell won't you love me? 
Why the hell won't you need me? 
Like I need you 
Why are you so far above me? 
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 
Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin
