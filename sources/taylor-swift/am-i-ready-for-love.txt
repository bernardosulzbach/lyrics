Am I Ready for Love?

Sometimes I wonder 
How it's going to feel 
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when 
My heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call? 
And my daddy tells me 
That I light up his world 
Every day he says, "Darling 
You're my best girl" 
He tried to teach me 
From the very start 
The meaning of love 
So nobody breaks my heart 
Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the boy? 
Am I ready for love? 
For love 
I know I'm not a little 
Girl anymore 
Because I'm feeling things 
I've never felt before 
Sweet sensations 
And anticipations 
Calling commotion 
To my emotions 
And I hear the words 
My daddy says to me 
He said, "Be true to yourself 
And keep your spirit free 
And love will find you 
One way or another 
Be good to yourself 
And be good to each other" 
Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for love? 
It's a run around the world 
And it's moving so fast 
Though I want to find 
A love that's going to last 
A love so strong 
That it can withstand 
The weight of the world 
In the palm of its hand 
Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for this game? 
Am I ready for the kiss? 
Am I ready for the stars? 
Am I ready for the bliss? 
Am I ready for love?
