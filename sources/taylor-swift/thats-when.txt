Taylor Swift
That's When

I said I know
 He said I need some time, need some space
 To think about all of this
 and I watched him go
 He watched me crash to the floor
 On my knees just like that
He said when can I come back
 I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
 That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
 Laughing when I'm crying
 That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
 That's when I never see your face
 I let you in, baby that's when
I said I know
 He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
 Put you through all of this
 'Cause I let you go, you let me think
 That I'd be fine without you
 Imagine that!
 So baby when can I come back?
 And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
 That's when , when it's sunny or stormin'
 Laughing when I'm crying
 That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
 That's when I never see your face
 I let you in, baby that's when
 And I said all this playing
 Did you ever think of me?
 And he said
that's when, when I woke up in the morning
 that's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
 Laughing when I was crying,
 and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
 that's when, when I saw youR fAce
 You let me in, and baby that's when
that's when ooooooh. ooh oh ooh oh oh
 I said I know
 he said I need some time, need some space
