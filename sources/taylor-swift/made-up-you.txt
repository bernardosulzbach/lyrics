Taylor Swift
Made Up You

Your feet under the table
I love it when they’re touching mine
Your hands make the cat's cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and made up you
You smile just like a picture
It doesn’t even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got
Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and made up you
I’d never let you go
Even If I could
Because I never could've dreamed you up this good
Oh, oh
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and made up you
Made up you
Oh, oh
Made up you
