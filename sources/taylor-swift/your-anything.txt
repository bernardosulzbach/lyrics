Your Anything

I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind 
wonderin if you'll ever find just what you want 
a hometown number one 
or a california loaded gun
but you you'll only get one 
ohh thats what you thought 
and heres what you got
i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
be your anything
if you want hard to get 
if you want (laugh)
all you have to do is let me know
if you want a bumby ride 
or someone with a softer side 
either one will be alright 
just let me know
cause this is how it goes 
i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you
but with someone like you it's so easy to do
and 
i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
thats what you need 
i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting
