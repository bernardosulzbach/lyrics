Lucky You

There's a little girl in this little town 
With a little too much heart to go around 
Live forever, never say never 
You can do better, that's what she says 
Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you 
Do do do do do do do do 
She sings her little song
She walks a long a little 
Pathway headed for the skies 
Left her travels, lives they unravel 
Mind over matter, that's what she says 
Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
And the fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you 
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you up to the skies 
Honey, she'll love you 
Funny how some view 
Angels above you ain't so far away. 
Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of 
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you
