Fall Back on You

Ooh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me [back in your heart]
Ooh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
(I want you back)
I want you back(x4)
Ooh baby
I want you back
(x2)
Ooh
Oh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me [back in your heart]
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
(x2)
Ooh baby
