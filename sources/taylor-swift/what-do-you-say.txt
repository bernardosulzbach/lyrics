What Do You Say?

What do you say when you just know
That he's the won and you wanna go fast but he's taking it slow?
And what do you do when he's next to you but he's a little bit shy?
Well here's something you could try
Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May, beautiful day and I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright it feels just like a day 
When everything's gonna go just right.
I know it will be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay-ay-yeah
What do you say?
What do you see when you look in his eyes?
There's something there that he can't disguise
No matter how he tries.
And what do you feel when you know it's real
And you can't sit still if you don't own up I will, yeah.
Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together

With the sun shining bright it feels just like a day 
When everything's gonna go just right.
I know it will be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay-ay-yeah
What do you say?
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about what I want you to say.
Hey, hey, what do you say?
