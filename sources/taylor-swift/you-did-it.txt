You Did It

You did it.  I canï¿½t believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?
You brought her to my party.
Did you think my friends wouldnï¿½t know?
Did you think I wouldnï¿½t care?
You asked if it was okay.
I didnï¿½t know what to say.
I lied.  What is left of today?
You did it.  I canï¿½t believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?
You still donï¿½t understand.
Why was I so hurt?  
We were just friends you say.
But no more.
You did it.  I canï¿½t believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?
She did me a favor when 
calling you on the phone.
She started the ball a-rolling when you 
didnï¿½t follow up.  That best friend of hers 
put the ball in play.
You did it.  I canï¿½t believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?
Iï¿½m free. Lesson learned.  
Cleansed from your curse.  Places 
I no longer want to be.
Now youï¿½re going backwards.
No more my life to share.
A mistake youï¿½re sure to repeat.
Not my problem now.
You did it.  I canï¿½t believe you did it.
What action should I take?
Turn the cheek?  More hurt to bear?
She did me a favor.  Now Iï¿½m free
Lesson learned.  Cleansed from 
your curse.  No more in your life to be.
