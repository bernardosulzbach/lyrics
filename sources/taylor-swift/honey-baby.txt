Honey Baby

I think of you every single evening 
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you
And I say:
Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
Except you, honey baby
Oh!
Flying high, I can see his smiling 
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Because you make me feel like flying
Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby
Oh!
Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I want to be
Drive me crazy, have me, baby
All I really want to say is:
Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
Oh, except you, honey baby
