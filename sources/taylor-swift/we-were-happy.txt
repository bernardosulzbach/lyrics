We Were Happy

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be back when we had all night
And we were happy.
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy.
When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We were happy.
We used to watch the sun go down 
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
Because we were happy.
When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We were happy.
Oh I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices, that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy.
When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy, yeah we were happy.
Oh, oh. We were happy.
