Taylor Swift
Forgiveness

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days 
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything 
And everybody believed in you

CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

But some things you can't speak of 
But tonight you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now 
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh 
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

BRIDGE:
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back
