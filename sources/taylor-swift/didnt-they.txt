Taylor Swift
Didn't They

She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day-at ten o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change.
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried!
Didn't she call you? 
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you, didn't she pray too?
He kissed his wife goodbye and took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night to put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle, three men walked and said:
"We're here to die for our God,"
He stood up and said:
"That's funny because my God died for me!"
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried!
Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you and didn't he pray too?
The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They road a hundred floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down.
And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you, where were you?
And didn't they pray too? Oh. 
I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day.
