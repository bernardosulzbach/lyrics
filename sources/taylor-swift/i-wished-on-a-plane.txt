Taylor Swift
I Wished on a Plane

Throwing pennies at the fountain
But when you're standing on the mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
Like the tree we cut our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving
Well I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Because I swore when you said that you loved me
Guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star
