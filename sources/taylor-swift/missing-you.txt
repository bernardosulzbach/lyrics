Taylor Swift
Missing You

(Spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton. Um, I met him a couple months ago doing a show out in California, um, and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said, "You know, I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music," and I read that and I'm like, wow, that's really cool. So I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows. And so, you know, I asked him to come out and sing with me. And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said, "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kind of silent but the crowd was like, "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? That's what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up, "Do you want to be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks." And, uh, he goes, "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kind of my point of asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video. Have ya'll seen that one? Would ya'll like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So, uh, the song I asked to sing with him, um, a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. You see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley. So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So, uh, Tyler, you going to sing a song with me?
Yeah, let's do it! If you guys know, sing along too.
Taylor:
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight
Tyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
But it's my heart that's begging 
Down this long distance line tonight
Both:
And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say
Tyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sending you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
But it's my heart that's breaking down 
This long dusty road of mine
Both:
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I aint missing you at all
No matter what my friends say
Taylor:
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heartache all alone
Both:
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No
(Spoken):
Good night everybody! Woo! You like that, girls?
