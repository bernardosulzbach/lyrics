Rise Against
Great Awakening

Buried words
Under lights
Soundtrack to this stagnant life
This meaning lost in translation
Message sucked out of his hands again
This could be my great awakening
But how would I know
'Cause it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?
Staring at the empty stares
Realize that he no longer cares about the wrong or right
The downward spiral begins tonight
And this could be my great awakening
But how would I know 'cause it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?
This could be my great awakening
But how would I know 'cause it's all noise to me
(Nothing I can do will make you hear)
