Making Christmas

This time, this time, making Christmas, making Christmas
Making Christmas, making Christmas, making Christmas is so fine
It's ours this time and won't the children be surprised?
It's ours this time
Making Christmas, making Christmas, making Christmas
Time to give them something fun
They'll talk about for years to come
Let's have a cheer from everyone, it's time to party
Making Christmas, making Christmas
Snakes and mice get wrapped up so nice
With spider legs and pretty bows
It's ours this time
All together that and this
With all are tricks we're making Christmastime, here comes Jack
I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams, my fantasies
Won't they be impressed, I am a genius?
See how I transformed this old rat into a most delightful hat
My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat
Consider thought this substitute, a bat in place of this old rat
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher, something pleasant
Try again, don't give up
All together, this and that
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
This time, this time, making Christmas, making Christmas
La, la, la, it's almost here and we can't wait
So ring the bells and celebrate 'cause when the full moon starts to climb
We'll all sing out it's Christmastime
