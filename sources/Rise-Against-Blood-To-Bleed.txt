Rise Against
Blood To Bleed

This place rings with echoes of
Lives once lived but now are lost
Time spent wondering about tomorrow
I don't care if we lose it all tonight
Up in flames, burning bright
Warming the air of the world
[Chorus:]
I don't love you anymore' is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
I have no more blood to bleed
As my heart has been draining into the sea
Since I've taken your footsteps
Getting me closer to what is left
Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know
Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?
[Chorus]
Still I wait
With a hope inside of me (inside of me)
So still (so still) I wait (I wait)
Until again we meet
Until again we meet
Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?
[Chorus]
Still I wait
With a hope (so still) inside of me (I wait)
So still (a hope) I wait (inside of me)
