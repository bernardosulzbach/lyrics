Dream Theater
Losing Time / Grand Finale

She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears make-up
But no one would care if she did anyway
She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away
Absence of awareness losing time
A lapse of perception losing time
Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach
From herself a behavior that kept her alive
Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand
The turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives
Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls
Deception of fame, vengeance of war
Lives torn apart, losing oneself
Spiralling down, feeling the walls closing in
A journey to find the answers inside our illusive mind
