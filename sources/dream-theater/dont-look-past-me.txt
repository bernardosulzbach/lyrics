Dream Theater
Don't Look Past Me

"I don't know, I feel a lot of distance and I feel far away.
I'll see you later..."
I have seen you born before me
I have watched you die
I have heard every word you said to me
Leave no question in your mind
There is no brighter star to guide you
Don't look past me to the sun, the sun is I
I am the sun...
So close the door behind him
He wanders slowly to the car
Trying to lift his heavy heart
He says...
"I feel bad about this.
I feel really bad about this.
Just, just let me feel bad about this."
I'm through just getting by
Countless times a friend has told me
Watch out for the wave
Now it seems the sea will be my grave
And still you swim to save me
Even though the water is much colder now
Even though the water is much colder now
Sometimes you can act on intuition
Sometimes you can use a different point of view
I've found that in such a position
I could always come to you
(Sun) I've seen you weep
I have seen you tired and lonely (without you)
But it only takes one heart (one heart)
To lift you up and send you on
Can you understand the life I've shown you
Understand it's me, I'm giving you
I have seen you born before me
I have watched you die
I have heard every word you said to me
I have no question in my mind
There's been no brighter star to guide me
I don't look past you to the sun,
so don't look past me to the sun,
The sun is...
And so love is broken
They're asking me how can you help
When you don't even know how that feels
I don't need one thousand reasons
When someone starts to cry
When someone says my heart needs lifting
Don't ask how come, ask how high
I have seen you born before me
I have watched you die
I have heard every word you said to me
Leave no question in your mind
There is no brighter star to guide you
Don't look past me to the sun, the sun is I
Leave no question in your mind
There is no brighter star to guide you
Don't look past me to the sun, (it knows where you are)
