Dream Theater
The Big Medley

I. In The Flesh
So 'ya 
Thought 'ya 
Might like to 
Go to the show 
To feel the warm thrill of confusion 
That space cadet glow 
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine? 
Is this not what you expected to see? 
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes? 
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise 
Lights... 
Roll the sound effects... 
Action... 
Shout out! (shout out) 
Shout out! (shout out) 
Shout out! (shout out) 
II. Carry on Wayward Son
[instrumental]
III. Bohemian Rhapsody
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye 
So you think you can love me and leave me to die 
Oh, baby 
Can't do this to me, baby 
Just gotta get out 
Just gotta get right outta here 
IV. Lovin, Touchin, Squeezin
You make me weep 
And wanna die 
Just when 
You said we'd try 
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' 
Each other 
When I'm alone 
Oh by myself 
You're out 
With someone else 
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' 
Each other 
You're tearin' me apart 
Every day, every day 
You're tearin' me apart 
Oh what can I say? 
You're tearin' me apart 
It won't be long, no 
Until you're alone 
When you're lover 
Oh he hasn't come home 
'Cause he's lovin', oh he's touchin', he's squeezin' 
Another 
He's tearin' you apart 
Every day, every day 
He's tearin' you apart 
Oh girl what can you say? 
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', another 
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry 
V. Cruise Control

VI. Turn it on Again
Turn it on 
Turn it on, turn it on again 
Turn it on 
Turn it on, turn it on again 
Turn it on 
Turn it on, turn it on again 
Turn it on 
Turn it on, turn it on again
