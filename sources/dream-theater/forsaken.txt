Dream Theater
Forsaken

For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream
Then rising suddenly I felt a chilly breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear
Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes
And take my hand
Give yourself up to me
I waited painfully for not to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson sting on her lips
I have to know your name
Where have I seen
Your face before?
My dear, why don't you be afraid?
Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes
And take my hand
Give yourself up to me
Take me far away
Close your eyes
And hold your breath
'Til the ends of the earth
Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Forsaken, fly away with me tonight
Awaken, renew my life
Now you are mine
Give yourself up to me
