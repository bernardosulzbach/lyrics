Dream Theater
Funeral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding

The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house is gonna grow and die
Oh it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said I'm sorry honey if I don't change the pace,
I can't face another day
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands
I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now 
While if the wind of change comes down your way girl,
You'll make it back somehow 
And love lies bleeding in my hand 
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man 
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan 
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band 
Love lies bleeding in my hands 
And love lies bleeding in my hand 
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man 
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan 
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band 
Love lies bleeding in my hands 
Oooooh oooh 
Oooooh 
Oh oh oh oh ooh 
Love lies bleeding in my hands 
Oooh 
Oooh ooh
