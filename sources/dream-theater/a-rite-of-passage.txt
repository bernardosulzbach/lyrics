Dream Theater
A Rite of Passage

This is the new world order
Plague upon our peers
Spreading accusations
Of radical fears
The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
Remain a mystery
Beneath the ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly
Turn the key walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay upon the stone
A rite of passage
Men of wealth and power
Influence and fate
Philosophers and leaders
Are members of the trade
Bound by open honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
An esoteric flux
Beneath the ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly
Turn the key walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay upon the stone
A rite of passage
Turn the key walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The seven stars the rising sun
A perfect world a new life has begun
A rite of passage
