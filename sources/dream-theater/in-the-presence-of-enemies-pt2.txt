Dream Theater
In the Presence of Enemies Pt.2

III. Heretic
Welcome tired pilgrim into the circle
We have been waiting
Everyone's gathered for your arrival
All the believers
Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us
I've been waiting for you,
weary preacher man
You have been expected
Now we can begin
Let this hallowed Day of Judgment reign
I have known you father
and your sacred quest
Blessed soldier fighting
You shall never rest
I have known you, but do you know me?
Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us
(My soul is yours, Dark Master…I will fight for you)
[CHORUS] Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside
I cannot see his face,
but I could feel his spite
A presence from the dead
Abandoned by the light
This shadow will consume him from within
This power that I sense
The rage behind those eyes
is just a shrouded ghost,
a spirit sealed inside
The body and the soul both threats, for they are one
Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us
(My soul is yours, Dark Master…I will fight for you)
[CHORUS]
Dark Master, amen, I belong to you
Dark Master within
Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!
(x3)
IV. The Slaughter of the Damned
Don't! Bother trying to find them
They will be coming to you
Fight! Fight and destroy until you can't take anymore
Slay! Spill the blood of the rebels
They are the children of hell
Flesh! Of the undead, stopping at nothing to kill
Sin! Caught in a moment of weakness
Committed the greatest of all
Sold! Half of my soul, and now it's too late for you
[CHORUS] I judge as my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
that lives in all of us
Unwelcome ones,
your time has come
Lord! You are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk! Through the abyss
into the shadow of death
Fear! There is no evil to fear now,
for I know you are with me
My! Cup overflows
with my enemy's blood
I! Decay in the house of the lord
Forever amen
Death! Will follow me all the days of my life
[CHORUS]
Servants of the fallen fight to pave the way
for their savior's calling on this wicked day
Through a veil of madness, with a vicious blade,
one man rises up standing in their way
It's time for your reckoning
V. The Reckoning (Instrumental)
VI. Salvation
My soul grows weaker
He knows and he waits
He watches over me,
standing at the infernal gates
In the hour of darkness,
the moment I feared has passed
The moment I lost my faith
Promising salvation
My soul is my own now
I do not fight for you, Dark Master
