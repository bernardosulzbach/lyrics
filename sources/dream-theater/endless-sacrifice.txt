Dream Theater
Endless Sacrifice

Cold, lying in my bed
Staring into darkness
Lost, I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return again
Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day
I'm so far away and so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make we whole
Try to stay alive, until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why, I chose this life
This superficial lie, constant compromise
Endless sacrifice
Pain, it saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light shines on my soul
While a thousand candles burn
Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still
You're so far away and so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole
Try to stay alive until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why I chose this life
This superficial lie, constant compromise
Endless sacrifice
Moments wasted, isolated
Time escaping, endless sacrifice
Moments wasted, isolated
Time escaping, endless sacrifice
Over the distance, we try to make sense
Of surviving together, while living apart
Striving for balance, we rise to the challenge
Of staying connected in spite of circumstance
All you've forsaken, and all that you've done
So that I could live out this undying dream
Won't be forgotten, or taken for granted
I'll always remember your endless sacrifice
Moments wasted, isolated
Time escaping, endless sacrifice
Moments wasted, isolated
Time escaping, endless sacrifice
