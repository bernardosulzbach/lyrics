Dream Theater
The Dark Eternal Night

No one dared to 
Speak of the terrible danger
The hideous ancient warnings 
Forged in the void of night
He has risen up 
Out of the blackness; chaos 
Belongs to the prophet's sister
A sickening monstrous sight
Through that stifling heat underneath the pale green moon
(Hungered with the thirst to see things not yet seen)
Climbing endless stairs, leading to the choking room
(Eager to explore his most shocking mysteries)
Drifting beyond all time
Out of the churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night
Black forces
Rage in a vortex, fighting
Rays of destruction swallowing
The echo of the universe
I am the last
Born of the blood of the pharaohs
The ultimate god of my creation
Sent to unleash this curse
Restless crowds draw near
Nameless hooded forms appear
(Amidst fallen ruins
Grotesque creatures battle)
Shadowed on a screen
Yellow evil faces leer
(Vacant monuments
Corpses of dead worlds left behind)
Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night
Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night
Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night
Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night
