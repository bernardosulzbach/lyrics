Dream Theater
Cover My Eyes

I've got my hands out in front of my face
But I can hardly see
I've bathed myself in holy water
But it doesn't bother me
Under my skin, upon my head
Inside the walls, beneath my bed
My black and whites are turning red
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind
I've got my fingers to the blade
But I can't feel a thing
Open my eyes in salty water
But it doesn't even sting 
Under my skin, upon my head
Stuck in my throat, beneath my breath
My black and whites are turning red
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind
Have I lost my mind
Have I lost my mind
Under my skin, upon my head
The lunatic is playing dead
My black and whites are turning red
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my
Have I lost my mind
Have I lost my mind
Have I lost my mind
