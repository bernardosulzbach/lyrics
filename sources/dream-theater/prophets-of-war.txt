Dream Theater
Prophets of War

It burns deep down inside of me
We have ourselves to blame
Not questioning, accept it as the truth
Debate this fight; it's just cause
The facts do not support theirs
To liberate a people
And rid them of tyrant rule
Is it time to make the change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
It's time to make the change
(A change)
Catch your attention
(Deceived)
Since the inception
(Afraid)
Fight for what reason?
(Come out)
Can we clean up this mess?
The loss of loved one's ignorant request
They continue the same rhetoric
These derelicts that profit, win or lose
Is it time to make the change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
It's time to make a change
(Time for change
Fight the fear
Find the truth
Time for change)
The only thing that I believe
Will help us see this through is faith
Pray they will forgive
Forgive our arrogance
So we can make it right
Right what they have wronged
(I see you sweat
Unexpected, controversial
Keep this two wet
Things are gonna get this to know
Your sympathy
A pitiful display, you studder
Your empathy, you've nothing if there is no honor
Responsible of this you are incapable
We implicate, incriminate, exacerbate; too much at stake
Our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters thoughts
Perpetuating their ideals, and mine are sad to stay the course 
Is it time to make the change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
Is it time to make the change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?
Is it time to make a change
A change from what it's been?
Can we help them break away?
Is our patience wearing thin?
It's time to make a change
(Time for change
Fight the fear
Find the truth
Time for change)
