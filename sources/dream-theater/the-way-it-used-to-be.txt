Dream Theater
The Way it Used to Be

Feelin' sick once again
I'd give anything
To be back home
Safe and warm inside
I can't stand the crowds
Or the smell that surrounds me
The cloth and key 
Still preach chastity
Take me back so I can see
The way it used to be
I lay down and enter a dream
Unlike anywhere I've been
All is silent and sweet
Then I'm falling down to the ground
And I'm lost from what I've found
Can't stand the sounds no more
Take me back so I can see
The way it used to be
The way it used to be
Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
Bring me to the land
Radio waves 
Splash through my head
To a rhythm that I crave
Radio waves 
Relive the moment 
Seems like yesterday
Take me back to Twelve Mile Bay
Where I'll sit at the edge with my feet in the water
Take me back as the sun fades away
Break down the walls so I can breathe
Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
The way it used to be
The way it used to be
Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
