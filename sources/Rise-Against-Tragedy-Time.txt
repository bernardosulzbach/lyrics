Rise Against
Tragedy + Time

All the edges of the sharpest knives
In the middle of the darkest nights
Always knew that I would find you here
In the bottom of the gravest tears
I've seen enough to see it's lonely where you are
Above the cloud
Been tangling by the rooftop
She wait from ledges for advice to talk her down
Nothing matters but the pain, you're all alone
The never ending night when you're awake
When you're playing out tomorrow, it's OK
There will be the time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on you won't forget some day
You can't forget some day
All that matters is the time we had
Doesn't matter how it all went bad
Never wonder what it might be like
Shut the door, say goodbye
When things grew tragically
We come alive or come undone
So don't look back
Let it shape you like a notion
Even the deepest scars in time will fade
Nothing matters but the pain, you're all alone
The never ending night when you're awake
When you're playing out tomorrow it's OK
There will be the time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on you won't forget some day
You can't forget some day
And sometimes you have to go back
To know just where you were then
But we're old enough to know that
What has been, will be again and again
And the bravest of faces are the ones where we fake it
And the roles that we play
Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
Despite the overwhelming odds, tomorrow came
And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay a while
You'll be ready then, to laugh again
Nothing matters but the pain
(We are tragedy, yeah, we are sympathy)
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see
Nothing matters but the pain
(We are misery, a distant memory)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learned to laugh again
Yeah, we all learned to laugh again
We all learned to laugh again
