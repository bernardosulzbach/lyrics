Rise Against
Death Blossoms

On dirt like stone
The life paste, the bones of men
That sought to overthrow
Or all that remains
Oh, what they stole
Was innocence, the slate once clean
Has gone as black as coal
Time and time again
Take a look around
The tide is turning upside down
The image of the world
Reflects inside the child's eye
This world
No self-control
No sense of time
No bleeding hearts, no long good-byes
We grow colder every day
But is it all a show?
A game we play
Society vice queens, so fucking bored
And so cliche
Take a look around
The tide is turning upside down
The image of the world
Reflects inside the child's eye
We eat our own to stay alive
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now, it's time
Take a look around
The tide is turning upside down
The image of the world
Reflects inside the child's eye
We eat our own to stay alive
Around, take a look around
Watch this world reflect
Inside a child's eye
We eat our own to stay alive
