Mountain of You

I can't wait til it's light out
There's some things, I should get them done
Tried inhaling some white out
Ended up with some bleeding gums
Anything I left in the closet
Shouldn't have a hard time getting out
If I had the time I could make it
Seems to me the chances are chasing
All the substance I've done without
And all the luck that I've hated
Aside from all of the petty doubt
Can't believe I have made it
I'm afraid of the dark now
That's the sign of a patsy
Round the time of the door brow
You should let it come in
Never put your face in the water
It hurts your eyes when they open up
Not that any different could matter
It's just a different conspirit
If there's one thing I could laugh about
It's all this mess I've created
I've tried the part of the sacred cow
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain
(guitar solo)
If there's one thing I could laugh about
And solve this mess I've created
I've tried the part of the sacred cow
I can't believe that i waited
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
