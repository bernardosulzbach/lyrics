Foo Fighters
Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'

You make me weep and want to die
Just when you said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other
When I'm alone all by myself
You're out with someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other
You're tearing me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearing me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearing me apart
It won't be long, yes, until you're alone
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home
Because he's lovin', oh, he's touchin'
He's squeezin' another
He's tearing you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearing you apart
Oh girl, what can you say?
Because he's lovin', touchin' another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
