Touch

Touch, light as a feather.
I will wait for you honestly.
I am yours - entirely.
I remember last night's dream.
Could it be your one of me?
I've known the face inside the window.
And the voice forever in my heart.
Like an angel's arrow.
I remember last night's dream.
Could it be your one of me?
I've been waiting silently.
Would you risk it all, with me?
Ah, Ah, Ah.
Ah, Ah, Ah.
(Guitar solo)
