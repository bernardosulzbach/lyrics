Spill

One of these nights I'll shake you
I will take you from my veins
I'm getting tired of waiting
It's time to empty me
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me
Feeling me race inside you
And I feel you run through me
Funny how you remind me
I got memories to drain
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you love to watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me
Bleed me slowly, until every, vein is empty, just like you
Bleed me slowly, until every, vein is empty, just like you
Please oh, please you're draining me, I've got to bleed myself from you
Please oh, please you're draining me, I've got to bleed, I've got to bleed for you!
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me
We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you love to watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me
