Bangin'

I'm no devil and I'm no saint
But i know what to do
With a little bit here and a little bit there
I'm gonna bring it home to you
I can change my ways, I can stretch my days
You know i payed my dues
Nothing can change what always remains
I keep bangin' on with you
I keep bangin' on with you
I keep bangin' on with you
There's nothing I can say or do
Bangin' on with you
Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa
Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa
I will break my neck, I can take it all back
Erase my name for you
Life ain't fair, but nothing compares
When I'm bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
We can share this blame, you can dance on my grave (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
I will swing along with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
If you're not scared, we can wake the dead (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
When I'm bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
I'll keep bangin' on with you
Bangin' on with you
There's nothing i can say or do
Bangin' on with you
Hang on we'll beat this out (Whoa-o)
Hang on we'll beat this out of you (Whoa-o)
Hang on we'll beat this out (Whoa-o)
Hang on we'll beat this out of you (Whoa-o)
Hang on we'll beat this out! (Whoa-o)
Hang on we'll beat this out of you (Whoa-o)
Hang on we'll beat this out! (Whoa-o)
I'll keep bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
There's nothing i can say or do
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
There's nothing i'd rather say or do
Bangin' on with you 
Hang on we'll beat this out 
Hang on we'll beat this out of you
Hang on we'll beat this out
Hang on we'll beat this out of you
Hang on we'll beat this out!
Hang on we'll beat this out of you
