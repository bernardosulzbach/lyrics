Hell's Garden

Blew it all away
Blew it all away
Living green and gray
Blew it all away
Read to pass the time
Sappy old brick line
Turns to yours and mine
Read to pass the time
You and I in hell's garden, hell's garden
The way it used to work
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Pray to wash the burn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Wait another turn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Will to burn
Blew it all away
Blew it all away
Living green and gray
Blew it all away
You and I in hell's garden, hell's garden
The way it used to work
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Pray to wash the burn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Will to the world
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Wait another turn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Wait another turn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Can't pray another word
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Will to the world
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Can't pray another word
