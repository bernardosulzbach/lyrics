Goodbye Lament

Say a prayer for me, in my memory.
Have a taste, another one is through.
Damn this place in me, damn this destiny.
I will be the one who cries when you go.
Hello misery, you're the best of me.
Hey, somone got the best of you.
Come and sleep with me for infinity.
We'll spend some time and find the rest of you.
Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Rain down
Innocence is dead
Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe
Pray for me, fading memories.
Give me time and i will fade into you.
Come and dance with me, i will always be
Sleeping behind the eyes that i'm bleeding through.
Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Way down
Innocence is dead
Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe
Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe
Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Way down
Innocence is dead
Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Way down
Innocence is dead
Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe
