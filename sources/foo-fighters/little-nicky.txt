Little Nicky

I knew a girl named Nicky 
I guess you could say 
She was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel loby
Masterbatin' with a magazine
She said,
'How'd you like to waste some time?'
And I could not resist 
When I saw little Nicky grind
She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said,
'Sign ur name on the dotted line.'
The lights went out
And Nicky started to grind
(Wooah Nicky!!!)
The castle started spinning 
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But me body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
She'll show you no mercy
But she'll show nuff - 
Show nuff, show ya how to grind
Woke up the next mornin'
Nicky wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said,
'Thank you for a funky time.
Call me up whenever you wanna grind'
(Wooah Nicky!!!) 
(Come back Nicky, Come back!!!)
