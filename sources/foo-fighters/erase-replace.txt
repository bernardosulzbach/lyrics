Attention
Pay attention
No mention
A sickest array
A mission
An admission
Ignition
Detonate
Oh no don't talk about it
No please don't talk about it
Oh no don't talk about it
Not one more word about it
Oh no don't think about it
No please don't think about it
Oh please don't think about it
It goes away
[Chorus:]
We made these promises
You made these promises
Erase
Replace
Erase
Replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase
Replace
Erase
Replace
A vision
Division
Revision
Recognate
An action
A reaction
Distraction
Question the fate
Oh no don't talk about it
No please don't talk about it
Oh no don't talk about it
It goes away
[Chorus]
Oh, are we better off now?
It's the only thing left said
Meant for you
Oh, are we better off now?
It's the only thing left said
Meant for you
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
