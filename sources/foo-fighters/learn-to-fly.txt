Learn to Fly

Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watch the last one die
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)
Think I'm done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
I'd give it all away
If you give me one last try
We live happily ever trapped
If you just save my life
Run and tell the angels
That everything is all right
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying  
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly
Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to
Looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly high
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly
Make my way back home
When I learn to
