Keep It Clean

Keep it clean
My momma said keep it clean
Keep it clean
My momma said keep it clean
Drivin' all night
Gotta hankerin' for somethin'
Think I'm in the mood for some hot man muffins
Mmmm, sounds so fine
Yes indeed
Keep it clean
My daddy said keep it clean
Keep it clean
My daddy said keep it clean
Aint lookin' for a fight
Aint lookin' for trouble
Howdy Mr. Right
Have you met Mr. Bubble?
Hey, putter there
Aint she sweet?
Rubbin' and a-lovin' and a-scrubbin' and a-truckin'
Maybe if we're lucky, just a little bear huggin'
Know what I mean
Keep it clean
