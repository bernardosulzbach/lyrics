How Do You Do

We sat and watched a new day melt 'til dawn.
Had my share of memories now it's time to move on.
Another lonely lesson never turned out wrong.
These things I've done without you - should have never been done.
Call on me and I'll shout down.
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
I've never felt this wrong and now I know.
This love was burning through me though it never did show.
Let's spend tonight together kissing stars below.
We'll hide inside each other - never let you go.
Call on me and I'll shout down.
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?

Call on me and I'll shout down.
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
