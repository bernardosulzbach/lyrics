Foo Fighters
With Arms Wide Open

Well I just heard
The news today
Seems my life
Is gonna change
I close my eyes
Begin to pray
As tears come streamin'
Down my face
With Arms Wide Open
Into the sunlight
I'll give you everything
Show you everything
With Arms Wide Open
Thank you brother
With Arms Wide Open
Enunciate
The way I please
I pray now
I'm on my knees
I went to church
On Sunday
Start the band
Start to get paid
With Arms Wide Open
Into the Puzin church
