What Did I Do?/God as My Witness

There you go again
Putting words into my mouth
This one's for you to know
And for me to find out
All that trouble, and you on about
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud
Stop, ask myself what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?
Come on, tell me now what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?
I heard every word comin' from the 13th floor
Your song came along
And I heard the voices telling me to save yourself
I'll behave yourself
I stop, ask myself what did I do?
What can I do to preserve you?
Come on, tell me now, what can I do?
What can I do to conserve you?
Your name, year of fame
I could see the writing on the wall
Come on, flip a coin, bet it's going to tell you
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself
Your man, channelin', knowin' by the X on his hand
You raise, runaways singin' at the gate
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself
So here I go again
Putting words into your mouth
This one's for me to know
And for you to find out
All that trouble and I'm on about
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud
All of your heroes, where are they now?
I'm lost, deliver me
I crossed the river finally
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight
