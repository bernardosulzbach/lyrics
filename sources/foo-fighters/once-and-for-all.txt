Once And For All

Oh misery come marshal me in,
No better place for me to begin. 
I'm coming in from out of this rain,
The time has come to wash you away.
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Oh gather round sing those sins, amen
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.
Oh bring to me your broken and blue,
No matter if it matters to you.
A longing like never before,
Ive had enough now i need more.
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Oh gather round sing those sins, amen.
My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war.
My time has come once and for all
My time has come this means war.
Hey. Forgive me debility,
I'll sing you all my sins.
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war. 
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.
My time has come, this means war 
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
