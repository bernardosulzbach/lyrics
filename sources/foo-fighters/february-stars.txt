February Stars

Hangin' on here until I'm gone
Right where I belong just hangin' on
Even though, watched you come and go
How was I to know you'd steal the show?
One day I'll have enough to gamble
I'll wait to hear your final call bet it all
Hangin' on here until I'm gone
Right where I belong, just hangin' on
Even though, pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown, it heals the soul
You ask for walls, I'll build them higher
We'll lie in shadows of them all
I'd stand, but they're much to tall
And I fall
February stars re floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
