Win Or Lose

I'm hangin' around, I not puttin' down the state I'm in 
I've never been proud, And now I'm allowed to shed my skin 
I'm driving away, I know if I stay I'll sit and spin. 
Imagine the day, I'm drowning if they can reel me in 
Pick up where I left off 
Lets make a bet 
We'll make a bargain and call this truce 
Let's make a bet 
I'm in loss and win or lose with you 
I see it all now, I'm taking my bow in everything 
Comes crashing around, Its getting too loud the space I'm in 
So now I can leave, two pieces of me some evidence 
The one that relieves, the others disease like medicine 
Pick up where I left off 
Lets make a bet 
We'll make a bargain and call this truce 
Let's make a bet 
I'm in loss and win or lose 
Speakin' in tongues I can't get through 
Think of runnin' but 
I'm tired of runnin' into you 
Speakin' in tongues the way I do 
Found that you understand quite well 
Cause that's your language too 
I'm hangin' around, I'm not puttin' down the state I'm in 
In love with the sound, its gettin' too loud
