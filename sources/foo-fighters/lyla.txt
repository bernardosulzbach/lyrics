Lyla

Calling on the stars to fall
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand
She believes in everything
In everyone and you and yours and mine
I waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out my mind
Heyyyyy Lyla
The star’s about to fall -
So what you sayyyy Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so …
Smallll Lyla
If you can hear me call and I can …
Sayyyy Lyla
Heaven can I help you catch me if I … fall
She’s the queen of all I’ve seen
And every song and city far and near
Heaven held my memories still
She ring the bell for all the world to hear
Heyyyyy Lyla
The star’s about to fall -
So what you sayyyy Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so …
Smallll Lyla
If you can hear me call and then I can …
Sayyyy Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I … fall
Heyyyyy Lyla
The star’s about to fall -
So what you sayyyy Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so …
Smallll Lyla
But you can hear me call and I can …
Sayyyy Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I … fall
