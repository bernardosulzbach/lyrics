Rise Against
Amber Changing

Information kept to myself and everyone wants to know, 
I trust the words of nobody else cause I've been there before, 
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening
The calloused fingers are wrapped around a black ball-point pen, 
These eyes don't wander as far as they at one time did, 
I've seen the future, it's fading faster
No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
I'm on the other end begging you, pick up the phone, 
A shaking whisper is answering, don't call anymore your voice is wasted 'cause no one's listening
Freeze me in that moment, thaw me in ten years,
When the fires burned out and the smoke (clears)
No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend, tonight will never end
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend, tonight
Will never end
No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
