Rise Against
Halfway There

Is this the point where we give up?
Is this the point where we give in?
Is this the point where we turn ourselves in?
Is this the time to ask questions?
Is this the time to seek answers?
Is this the time to throw it all in?
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
You're halfway there
That's when you know that you're halfway there
This is the point where we stand up
This is the point where we take back
The things that are keeping us from being free
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
That's when you know that you're halfway there
Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end,
The wasted time I spent ashamed I called you friend,
Give me one reason, I need a reason, one reason
