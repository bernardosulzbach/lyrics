Rise Against
The Great Die-Off

There's a fire on the borders 
And it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger 
And it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave
And the world says we reap what we sow
To where I bury you up in my home
The nights we'll reclaim but we’re sick of the wait
We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out
With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours
We want it all and we want it now
A tide has come in to drown you out
We make ourselves at home while your body’s still warm
Creation tell us that the rituals 
Are only just clocks on wrong times
And something triggers each 
And every time I hear you say
God bless this place
But your numbers are dwindling now
Though endangered we'll still hunt you down
With heads on a stake long may you reign
We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out
With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours
We want it all and we want it now
A tide has come in to drown you out
We make ourselves at home 
While your body’s still warm
And there's a fire on the borders 
And it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger 
And it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave
We want the motherfucking world and we want it now
Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out
With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours
No I don't want to wait
I know I better way
So step aside, come on or better yet just go away
Our chance has finally come
Tomorrow I’ll be another one now
No I’m not gonna wait
We want it now
Yeah we’re dousing the flames
We want it now
