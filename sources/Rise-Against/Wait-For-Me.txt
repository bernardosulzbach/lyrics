Rise Against
Wait For Me

Do you see the world in different colors?
Do you see the world in black and gray?
Alone in your thoughts
How many others have stood where you stand
Where you stand today?
I've stood where you stand
But all, can you
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all that defiles
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
The end's robbed me now
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now
The promise of safe return undelivered
The ocean is wider than I first guessed
When roads disappeared, I followed the rivers
But somehow got in over my head
So deep I felt taken
Wait for me now
Take off this crown
To break all that defiles
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
The end's robbed me now
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now
A lost dream of what could have been
A house on fire, a tangled web
The key turns to find the locks have changed
In time to hear the back door slam
A sound that to this day I can't forget
The colors drained to black and gray
Oh
Wait for me now
Take off this crown
To break all that defiles
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
The end's robbed me now
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now
