Rise Against
Who'll Stop the Rain (CCR cover)

As long as I remember the rains been coming down
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain?
I went down Virginia, to seek shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, we watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain?
We heard the singer playin', and how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, just tryin' to keep warm
But still the rain kept fallin', fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain?
