Rise Against
A Gentlemen's Coup

The pain, disorder 
A cataclysmic dawn 
We trusted but something has gone wrong 
We bought it 
But woke to find it gone 
Impact in 5, 4, 3, 2 
The place before 
The radiation creeps 
On cats' feet 
We scatter in the streets 
She asks me "do you think it's safe to breathe?" 
It doesn't look that way to me 
We storm the gates 
Raise the flags 
Just the same old story 
We seize the throne, subjugate 
We should have burned it to the ground 
Whoa
Some might say we've lost our way 
But I believe we've not gone far enough 
Afraid, we cower 
To interests not our own 
The power to free or to control 
We let it skip through 
Our fingers to the bone 
Watch as the bodies wash ashore 
Whoa
Nobody lives here anymore 
We storm the gates 
Raise the flags 
Just the same old story 
We seize the throne, subjugate 
We should have burned it to the ground 
Whoa
Some might say we've lost our way 
But I believe we've not gone far enough 
And how long will we fall for this? 
And how long will we fall for this? 
How long will we fall for this? 
And how long will we fall? 
And how long will we fall for this? 
And how long will we fall for this? 
And how long will we fall for this? 
How long, how? 
We storm the gates 
Raise the flags 
Just the same old story 
We seize the throne, subjugate 
We should have burned it to the ground 
Whoa
Some might say we've lost our way 
But I believe we've not gone far enough
