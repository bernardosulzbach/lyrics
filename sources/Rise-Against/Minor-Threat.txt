Rise Against
Minor Threat

We're not the first, I hope we're not the last
'Cause I know we're all ready for that adult crash
The time is so little, the time belongs to us
Why is everybody in such a fucking rush?
Take your time
And Try not to forget
We never will
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
Yeah we're just a minor threat
So we're just a minor threat
Yeah we're just a minor threat
Early to finish, I was late to start
I might be an adult, but I'm a minor at heart
Go to college, be a man, what's the fucking deal?
It's now how old I am, it's how old I feel
Make do with what you have
Take what you can get
Pay no mind to us
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
Yeah we're just a minor threat
So we're just a minor threat
So we're just a minor threat
Fuck yeah!
