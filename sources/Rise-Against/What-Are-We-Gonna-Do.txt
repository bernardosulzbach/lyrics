Rise Against
What Are We Gonna Do

What are we gonna do?
Said the hungry child to a father with empty hands
What are we gonna do?
When the smoke clears
And reveals no promise land
What are we gonna do?
I don't know, it's a long, long way to go.
What are we gonna do?
Smashed across the table like a pile of fallen leaves
She stares down at unpaid bills then up at him
And unaware the journey that his father made for him
But when the man asked for his papers
He replied with empty hands
Then from the graves we dig for dreams, not realize
Do you hear these muffled cries?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
And who is going to answer for our sins
Could it be you?
Or me, when they lift our fingerprints
What are we gonna do?
I don't know, it's a long, long way to go
What are we gonna do?
Somewhere in the spaces of a 9 round magazine
The cowards pulling triggers at the seam
And the apple of our eyes cannot survive these sharpened teeth
Like Abraham and Isaac,
We will sacrifice and like it
And when the sun sets
We will wait there patiently
We fall sleep but we don't dream
What are we gonna do?
Said the lion to the lamb
As they drew lines in the sand
Said the trees to the man
When there were no seeds left to plant
Said the widow to the grave
As her roses fade away
Said the hills to the sky
As they kissed our last goodbye
Said the worker to the chief
Less like a boss, more like a thief
Said the ocean to the shore
As the tides grow more and more
Said the soldier to the priest
What is it that I should believe?
Said the desert to the rain
When will you visit us again?
How can we explain to children dancing in the rain
What are we gonna do?
