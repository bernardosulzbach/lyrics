Rise Against
Sudden Life

Floating in the clouds, giving up the fight
A voice is calling out, I'm walking into the light
We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast
Feet they barely even touched the ground
We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world
The fury and the sun
A sun flickered like a television set
Bright flashes of a warning sign
Vapid shadows in a world gone static
We're running away line by the fading line
Under water for years weâ€™re fine, 
Till we started to swim, then drown
The current takes us,
Now we're walking into the light
Are you dying all your life? (Walking into the light)
Broken, beaten, tired of 
You wanted to love but don't know how 
Diagnosis sudden life 
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light
Woke up falling on a wave of golden sound
Tunnel vision and a great beyond
Heart beating like a rhythm slowing down
Now it's gone, I let go of a soul
A flat line and I'm closing down
Whisper a warm farewell
The flames all beckon me
As we're walking into the light
Are you dying all your life? (Walking into the light)
Broken, beaten, tired of 
You wanted to love but don't know how 
Diagnosis: sudden life 
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light
Don't suppose that you know the way
Don't suppose that you care
I see lights up ahead and hear 
Cries of angels ringing in my ears
But you know that, had you a choice, 
You would go back and do it again
We all have unfinished business to tend
So no I won't go gentle
Into the good night
You can keep your candle
I'm walking away from the light
Yeah I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
Diagnosis sudden life (Walking into the light)
I woke up my heart racing, I'm 
At a loss explaining why 
Are you dying all your life? 
Now put your darkest days behind
And laugh as its right before your eyes 
And for very the first time,
It feels like I'm walking away from the light
