Rise Against
Roadside

Tell me what I'm supposed to do 
With all these left over feelings of you 
'Cause I don't know 
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel 
When all these nightmares become real 
'Cause I don't know 
[Chorus] 
And I don't think you see 
The places inside me that I find 
(together) 
And I don't know how we 
Separate the lies here from the truth 
 (time)
And I don't know how we 
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew 
Exactly what we're supposed to do 
(together) 
So leave me at the roadside 
And hang me up and out to dry 
So leave me at the roadside 
And hang me up and out to dry 
[Chorus] 
And I don't think you see 
The places inside me that I find 
(together) 
And I don't know how we 
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew 
Exactly what were supposed to do 
(together) 
So leave me at the roadside 
And hang me up and out to dry 
So leave me at the roadside 
And hang me up and out to dry 
[Chorus] 
'Cause I don't think you see 
The places inside me that I find 
(together) 
And I don't know how we 
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew 
Exactly what we're supposed to do 
(tim) 
...exactly what to do
