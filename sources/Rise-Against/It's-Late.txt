Rise Against
It's Late

Wrapped up in a short black coat worn thin
A hand around her match to block the wind.
She smiled as the smoke escaped her lips
Then let her hand fall gently away from this.
Cause it's late now, and I'm tired of all these games
And the cold night stings my skin.
I won't say it now, but I get closer everyday to letting this world win
And the city chokes on everything it makes
But the sunrise heals every heart it breaks.
And not unlike the birds, we all sing songs
To celebrate, to mourn, or just hang on
Cause it's late now, and the day has not been kind
So I came here to forget
It's a hard town, but I hold my head up high
Like a death row cigarette
Cant this all wait 'til the morning
I can't think straight right now
Seems like we're better off without these clenched fists
All boxing us in, I want out, I want out
Like Christmas lights left up 'till mid-July
We kept alive something that should have died
And everyday another light burns out
'till on this street we are the darkest house
Cause it's late now, and everybody's left
And I think I might too
Like my mother said, you always leave with who you bring
And I came here with you
