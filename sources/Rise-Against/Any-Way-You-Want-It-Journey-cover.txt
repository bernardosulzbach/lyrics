Any Way You Want It (Journey cover)

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
She loves to dance
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves a lot of things
All night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Oh baby, hold tight
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I was alone, I never knew
What good love could do
Then we touched and we sang
About the lovely things
All night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Oh baby, hold tight
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, all night, all night
All night, oh baby, hold tight
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
And she said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh, every night
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh baby, hold tight
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh, every night
