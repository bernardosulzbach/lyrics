Rise Against
Grammatizator

We celebrate the downfall with ticker tape parades
Oblivious to the fucking mess left lying in the wake
"God grant me the strength to let my children starve"
He whispered to the dripping roof into the candled dark
Contemplate contracts of gold
Just wave your hand and relinquish control
Nine lives await to unfold
We bury ten thousand stories untold
Flirt with insurrection batting eyes from afar
In skybox seats or hotel suites, six figure fucking cars
Contemplate contracts of gold
Just wave your hand and relinquish control
Nine lives await to unfold
Bury the stories
Control the heart
Control the mind
Control the hands
To build what they've designed
Lifetimes of silence and apathy
Ensure the prompt demise of our humanity
Contemplate contracts of gold
Just wave your hand and relinquish control
Nine lives await to unfold
We bury ten thousand stories untold
The stories untold
