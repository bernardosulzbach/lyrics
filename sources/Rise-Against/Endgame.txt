Rise Against
Endgame

And on that day they'll tell you
That life hung on with no clue
The warning signs were all just missed or shattered down
So it goes
The kings all failed to tell us
The madmen failed to sell us
Of what would then befall the only life we know
When they're burning signal fires
To guide us to the fields
We're building funeral pyres
They all commit a final appeal
The city lines are down
The kerosene's run out
The fact surreal
We relied upon
I shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
'Cause all the shoulders I wish to cry on gone
The paranoia gripped us
Berate and then consume us
The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts
Spreading through
We've been on fire like genius
I pray for god to save us
There was no answer, though
Disease tore us apart
We left bodies in the fields
So numb that we forgot how to feel
The city lines are down
The kerosene's run out
The fact surreal
We relied upon
I shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
'Cause all the shoulders I wish to cry on gone
He looked at the fields, and then his hands
All I need is what I have
Then fell a tear of happiness
Oh, she watched it all crumble away
Is this the end of yesterday?
"Lord, I hope so" is all he said
Gone are the cold cold wars
All I've got are the ?
And as we go forth
I pray we'll remember this day
Oh, we relied on now
The city lines are down
The kerosene's run out
The fact surreal
We relied upon
I shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
With no more shoulders, shoulders to cry on now
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
The weight that we once felt is gone
