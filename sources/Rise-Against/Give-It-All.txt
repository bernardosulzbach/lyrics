Rise Against
Give It All

Break through the undertow,
Your hands I can't seem to find,
Pollution burns my tongue, 
Cough the words I can't speak so I stall myself again, then I fall to the surface, 
Fill my lungs with air, 
Then let it out 
I give it all, 
This is the reason that I sing, 
So give it all, 
Cause it's these reasons that belong to me
Rock bottoms where we live, 
And still we dig these trenches, 
Bury ourselves in them, 
Backs breaking on the tension
For far too long these voices, 
Muffled by distances, 
It's time to come to our senses, 
And from the dark
We give it all, 
This is the reason why I sing, 
So give it all, 
It's these reasons that belong to me
Breathe, the air we give, 
The life we live, 
Our voices raising distances, 
So when my tongue, 
Break into song, 
You seize a competition, 
So please believe your eyes, 
Of sacrifice, 
Is not what we had in our minds, 
I'm coming home tonight, home tonight
We give it all, 
This is the reason why I sing, 
So give it all, 
It's these reasons that belong to me
Today I offer myself up to this I'm living for my dying wish,
I give it all, 
Now there's a reason, there's a reason, 
To give it all
