Rise Against
Lanterns

This night will fall like any other
Daylight subsides and shadows crawl out from under 
That corner's hiding something stirs
Oh so restless, cracked windows opened wide
Deadbolt turns, doors creak open
Whispers and moonlight there to guide
Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens round our flame
While the world sleeps we are awake
The black bird calls, it sings a chorus
While the gathering swells 
The flames built tall right before us 
As drums keep pounding
And the masses now are fusing 
Bodies pressed and tangled
As we revel in confusion our inhibitions thrown into the fire
Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens round our flame
While the world sleeps we are awake
Here in the dark we are safe from the judgment
And now arm in arm, locked tight so no one gets in
The Heaven-sent say, \"Child you are Hellbent\"
But Hell is not where we're going
Hell's where we've been
Come raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens around the flame
And while the world sleeps we are awake
Raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens around the flames
While the world sleeps we are awake
(Raise your lantern to the sky)
Yeah we are alone
We are awake
(Raise your lantern to the sky)
Yeah we are the light
We are the way
