Rise Against
Intro/Chamber the Cartridge

This is noise
Down beyond these city streets
Through gutters filled with black debris
In alleys void of any light
Where nameless things live out of sight
Down through the scrapers of the sky
Past neon words glowing all night
Echoes my name between each car
Are you happy where you are?
Blind to this impending fate
We let the world carry our weight
It's back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial
Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours and yours is mine, let's go
And so we carry on each day
As if our lives are not so gray
While every breath that we take
We only suffocate
Brush past a myriad
Of scenes a homeless vet crashed on wall street
A single mom of three
A TV personality
Blind to this impending fate
We let the world carry our weight
It's back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial
Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours and yours is mine
Save us, from what we have become tonight
Eyes, glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Save us, from what we have become tonight
Eyes, glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Save us, from what we have become tonight
Eyes, glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours and yours is mine
