Rise Against
About Damn Time

A death knell sounds
No matter where I go
A city or small towns
All I want
Is something to call my own
But I'm in the dark now
We set up confidently
But what if we were wrong
We shound have been there long ago
Shouldn't take this long
We stumbled accidentally
To a place unknown
CHORUS
It's about damn time we swallow the pain
Before it spreads
Memories we don't want to know
I still wake up with the same song 
And it's stuck in my head
The melody always take me home
Take me home
(Take me home)
I'm standing now
Waiting with both eyes closed
For whatever is left
A fist smacks down
Black eyes and broken bones
Maybe a soft kiss
I'm tired of always guessing
Whether the sky will fall
It's time to learn my lesson
I forget it all
The time we spend preparing
We always miss it all
CHORUS
To save the broken branch
We cut them in half
You said "I wish I could help you"
I said "You already have"
CHORUS
Take me home
