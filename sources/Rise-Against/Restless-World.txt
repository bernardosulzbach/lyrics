Rise Against
Restless World

I fell for the bait again
A fork in the road and one never ends...
And upon those stones I lay out alone to find you...
And a whisper like leaves in the wind,
An air so pure it could wash away sin...
A message like a stranger we take kind to
In the night it sings to me
As I fall asleep
Each breath slower than the last
A sweet, low tide recedes
We can almost hear the choir
Echoing down streets on fire
Singing,
"Keep calm, restless world, this too shall pass."
Are we all failures in disguise?
For the dream we brought to life,
From behind our name in lights
Our shadows cast...
But will they last?
It's not that I don't believe
It's just that I'm so afraid to bleed.
If we could just stay on the mountain path, over debris
So I can breathe again,
So we can live like we lived back then,
When these lakes were only puddles
And these monsters were still men...
'Cause we are but saddled horses
As they bet on every race
But there's contempt bred in the stallion
For the man that calls it's name!
We can almost hear the choir
Echoing down streets on fire
Singing,
"Keep calm, restless world, this too shall pass."
Are we all failures in disguise?
For the dream we brought to life,
From behind our name in lights
Our shadows cast...
And feet don't fail me now
There's a broken lonely town
Waiting somewhere down this empty road
And lungs please don't give out
Words we whisper and sometimes shout
And until they're heard,
I'm never going home...
I fell for the bait again...
