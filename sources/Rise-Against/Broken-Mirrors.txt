Rise Against
Broken Mirrors

Hey, man did you hear
Your final days are near?
A freefall of fire and ice
And explosions in the sky
A fate that we deserve
There's no escaping
No it's your turn
Now it's your turn
It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to show what we hear
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
Hey, hey!
Hey, man, you got the time?
Hey, can I trouble you for a light
No, me? no, I'm not the old town cryer
I'm the one who sets it all on fire
A fate that we deserve
And there's no escaping
No, it's your turn
Now it's your turn
It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to show what we hear
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
We hide from the mirrors
They might show our scars
And hear us
Reflection that we want to be
The people we are (the people we are)
Fight your reflection
Smash what you see
And let's restart
'Cause mirrors can't see our heart
It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to show what we hear
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
