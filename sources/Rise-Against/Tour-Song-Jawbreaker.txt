Rise Against
Tour Song

Seven hundred miles to play to fifteen angry men
I need some sleep
They hate the songs
We hate them too, yeah
This show is free
Fifteen minutes in broke another fucking string
Just call it luck
They start to leave
I start to plead
Someone, someone yells you suck
Suddenly that joe kicks on in my veins
And I cool down
Things sound good right now
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears, and move as one
Funny how no one knows we came
They wouldn't come anyway
Should I feel grateful to play
I'm living life my way
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go of everything I had left at home
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go...
Two cool kids they came
They're huddled by the door
Eyes wide with fright
A guy, a girl, in love with the whole world
It almost makes it right
Suddenly that joe kicks on in my veins
And I cool down
Things sound good right now
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears, and move as one
Funny how no one knows we came
They wouldn't come anyway
Should I feel grateful to play
I'm living life my way
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go of everything I had left at home
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go of everything I had left at home
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing must go wrong
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing must go wrong
