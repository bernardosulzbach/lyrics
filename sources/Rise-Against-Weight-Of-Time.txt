Rise Against
Weight Of Time

Speak with hesitation
Talk with reservation
Blood on your hands
Dried long since
But guilt still glowing in your eyes
You hide behind
(And now this blood has long since dried)
Your perfect crime
(Guilt still glowing in your eyes)
Never ask why you try
Now I've watched you stack
The mistakes you've made
On top of the lies
To hide them
Your excuses just don't add up
Empty handed we all wonder
Why you hide behind
(And now this blood has long since dried)
Your perfect crime
(Guilt still glowing in your eyes)
Never ask why you try
Now I know that
Your words
Your actions
Intentions
All were lies
Your heart grows heavier with time
(And now this blood has long since dried)
Have I said enough?
Have I said too much?
Is it your responsibility to decide?
Your heart grows heavier with time
(I will decide)
And I fell victim to the changing tide
And this blood has long since dried
This blood has long since dried
