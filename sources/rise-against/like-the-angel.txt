Rise Against
Like The Angel

They turn the lights down low,
In shadows hiding from the world,
Only coming out when it gets cold
The seas part when they hit the floor,
The voices carry on and out the door
And everything you touch turns into gold
Like the angel you are you laugh creating a lightness in my chest,
Your eyes they penetrate me,
(your answer's always 'maybe')
That's when I got up and left
A beating heart and a microphone,
A ticking clock in an empty home
Still tells of these times so long ago,
And even though I've come so far, I know
I've got so far to go and any day now I'll explode
Like the angel you are you laugh creating a lightness in my chest,
Your eyes they penetrate me,
(your answer's always 'maybe')
That's when I got up and left
Each and everyday it leads into tomorrow
And tomorrow brings one less day without you
But don't wait up just leave the light on
Cause all the roads that I might take will all one day lead back to you
Like the angel you are you laugh creating a lightness in my chest,
Your eyes they penetrate me,
(Now this is too amazing)
That's when I got up and left
