Rise Against
Zero Visibility

I’m saddling in here for the long haul
Can’t hide forever is what they say
In with the wind, out with a bang
Meanwhile nothing has changed
With each one slowly ordered
A storm brews in her eyes
A miss shot at the buzzard
Time whether wasted or well spent is still time
We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest times
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don’t recognize
But we return here all together
The moments of clarity here are short lived
Bleed through the bandages again
The wind is a lie, no longer white
Black as a day without sun
Passed out in a gutter
Woke up in your arms
Nursed back into color
The same touch that heals me
Left the scar
We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest times
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don’t recognize
But we return here all together
And the world works in ways that I never
Have claimed to know
We got out and fought through the weather
But it followed
The view from here isn’t better
But it’s all we know
It’s all we know
We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the edge of the borderlines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
Who we become you won’t recognize
But became them all together
All together
