Rise Against
Escape Artists

Under cover of the dark night  
Avoid the cloud of street lights  
And disappear at dawn
Camouflage ourselves again by  
Hiding here in plain sight  
Waiting for a sign to come  
Its the lottery of life  
We all play to just get by  
But some of us escaped  
We found a better way, a better life  
The ones that got away now  
Drifted from the herd  
Slipped through the fingers of your rule  
The ones that got away now  
Never to return  
We left your world and built our own  
And off the grid we're building  
Able but unwilling  
To bow to this design  
There is a light, there is a way out  
Safe before we all drown  
The boundaries have been redefined  
We are products of a place  
But our ties have been erased  
A wilderness awaits  
And lost in something we've been trying to find  
The ones that got away now  
Drifted from the herd  
Slipped through the fingers of your rule   
The ones that got away now  
Never to return  
We left your world, to build our own  
Give up our place  
In line to run so far away  
To break free from  
This endless race its never won  
This endless pace we can't outrun  
The blade spinning closer  
We keep our composure  
We are the ones that got away now  
Drifting from the herd  
We are the ones that got away now  
Never to return  
And from your clutches we're escaping  
Yeah from your grip, we are breaking free  
We got away  
Yeah, got away  
We got away  
Yeah
