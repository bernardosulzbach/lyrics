Rise Against
The Ghost of Tom Joad

Men walkin' 'long the railroad tracks
Goin' someplace there's no goin' back
Highway patrol choppers comin' up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge.
Shelter line stretchin' 'round the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleepin' in their cars in the Southwest
No home, no job, no peace, no rest.
Well, the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad.
He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
Waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass.
He got a one-way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the city's aqueduct.
Well, the highway is alive tonight
But where it's headed everybody knows
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad.
Now Tom said : 'Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy'
'Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries'
'Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air'
'Look for me, Mom, I'll be there'.
'Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand'
'Or decent job or a helpin' hand'
'Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free'
'Look in their eyes, Ma, you'll see me, yeah'.
The highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes
I'm sittin' downhere in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad.
Well, the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad
Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad
Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad.
