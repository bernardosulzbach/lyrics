Rise Against
Last Chance Blueprint

Late nights and bloodshot eyes, clock ticking half past five, we're barely breathing but we're still alive. GO!
Our plans are all laid out, take all these unmarked roads, we blaze the trails to places no goes, yeah!
One last chance to go, if I don't leave tonight I never will
One last chance to go, let's take it now in for the kill
If in time we find ourselves, back where we started from, too weak to fight and much too tired to run
Before you swallow me into your perfect life, I'm not going out without a fight, yeah!
One last chance to go, if I don't leave tonight I never will
One last chance to go, let's take it now in for the kill
But this blueprints faded grey and here it seems like just yesterday when we mapped out the details of our great escape,
But still these roads all beckon me to uncover their mystery
But I fall like dead autumn leaves and let the jetstream carry me
One last chance to go, if I don't leave tonight I never will
One last chance to go
