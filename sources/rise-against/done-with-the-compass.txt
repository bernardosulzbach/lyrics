Rise Against
Done with the Compass

Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake?
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
There's a burden you've been bearing in spite of all your prayers
There's a light turned off inside your heart
Can you remember what it's like to care?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe
So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa
The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
But the memories that haunt us are cherished just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grey
And yet I fall, through these clouds, reaching, screaming
Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa
This grip loosens but it never breaks (NEVER BREAKS!)
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall (BREAK MY FALL!)
In them I find the comfort to see through it all
Guide me through unchartered waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass until forever?
Until forever ends!?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe
So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa
Don't let me go, whooaa
Don't let me go, whooaa
