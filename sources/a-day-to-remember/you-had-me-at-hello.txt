A Day to Remember
You Had Me at Hello

I'm missing you so much, I'll see you die tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know these times are hard and I feel this too
But none of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you.
And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you
What have I gotten into this time around?
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello.
I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, even more with everyday that goes by
I watch the clock to make my timing just right
Would it be okay?
Would it be okay?
If I took your breath away?
And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you
What have I gotten into this time around?
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello.
(You gave me butterflies at the mailbox)
You had me at hello.
