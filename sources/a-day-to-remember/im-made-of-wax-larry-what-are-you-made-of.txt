A Day to Remember
I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?

Don't blink,
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think,
That I'll always be gone
You know I've got you,
Like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down
So run like hell
Sleep with one eye open
You can forgive or forget
You will tell everyone the damage done
Too bad you can't stop me
You can't stop me now
I'll be there just to watch you fall
So don't push me
I've got nothing to lose
Don't blink,
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think,
That I'll always be gone
You know I've got you
Like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down
There I go again,
I mean its so damn hard
To come back from the mess that you've made
Let me tell you I told you so
Your a snake and I confess
Just use your head
I'll be there just to watch you fall
So don't push me,
I've got nothing to lose
Don't blink,
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think,
That I'll always be gone
You know I've got you
Like a puppet in the palm of my hand,
Don't you let me down
Don't blink,
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think,
That I'll always be gone
You know I've got you
Like a puppet in the palm of my hand,
Don't you let me down
Come on, ooh
Everybody's out to get me
Any moment could be my last
This is it,
You can take it or leave it
Will you run? I will stand on my own two feet
Just breathe
Just breathe
Don't blink
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know I've got you
Like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down
Don't blink
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know I've got you
Like a puppet in the palm of my hand,
Don't you let me down, oh
