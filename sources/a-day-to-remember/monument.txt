A Day to Remember
Monument

It's Monday morning and I would kill for a chance to drive
Far away from here with you my dear
That I'll never leave your side
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me, 
To be a monument for the rest of them
We're getting older and I've started to fear for my life
Is this the way that it should be?
This whole thing's riding on me
It's been a long road so far with nowhere to turn
There's no looking back from here, no more dwelling on my fears
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me, 
To be a monument for the rest of them
Twenty bucks says you'll remember me when you see me on your TV screen
It may be the first time, but won't be the last time
I'll scream so loud that everyone in this place will hear every word I say, 
'Cause this is my time, this is my time to shine
Let nothing stand in our way
Twenty bucks says you'll remember me when you see me on your TV screen
It may be the first time, but won't be the last time
