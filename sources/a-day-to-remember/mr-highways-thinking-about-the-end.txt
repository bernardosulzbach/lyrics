A Day to Remember
Mr. Highway's Thinking About the End

Wake up!
Oh how the times have changed
Your not the person I knew back then
Lets get this straight
This is a calling where fist are flying
You lack of inspiration
Where not the same
I'll do whatever it takes
To get it through to you
When you come here today
Where not the same?
You are worthless
Stay in your place
It's like speaking gets tough
To all of you now
Will we ever (will we ever) get what we deserve
How long until the tables turn
Will we ever (will we ever) get what we deserve
I've created a monster
It's a side of me that
No one should see
So quit stalling
'Cause your backs keep walking away
Your likeness to destruction
We are not the same
I've struggled too long to sit back
And let you take this from me
We are not the same
I have giving everything
It's like speaking gets tough
To all of you now (to all of you now)
Will we ever (will we ever) get what we deserve
How long until the tables turn
Will we ever (will we ever) get what we deserve
(Get what we deserve) Get what we deserve
Get what we deserve
Disrespect your surrounding
You won't make it out alive
You won't make it out alive
You won't make it out alive
You won't make it out alive
It's like speaking gets tough
To all of you now
Will we ever (will we ever) get what we deserve
How long until the tables turn
Will we ever (will we ever) get what we deserve
Will we ever get what we deserve
Will we ever get what we deserve
