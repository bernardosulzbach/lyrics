A Day to Remember
A Shot in the Dark

Lets take them back to the days
When we were family
My breath was your breath, when we were young
I think it's funny how the times have changed
Throw being jealous in the mix
And now all I know of you is a name
Couldn't have came at a better time
This ends right now
We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
Were only hurting us
We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
We're only hurting ourselves
I'm a god amongst the ants and your girlfriends
And you act like you don't even know
'Cause you haven't been here for too long
I called this right from the start
I turn my back for one second now all I hear is a shot in the dark
Use my name like you know me
You're all the same
Keep running your mouth (x2)

We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
We're only hurting us
We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
We're only hurting ourselves
(Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves)
Mark my words, we're taking over the world (x4)
