A Day to Remember
I Heard It's the Softest Thing Ever

Tonight I'm sending a message
This is the end of an era
The end of second chances
In the face of defeat
I'm winning
Yet, you still have so much left to say
They're coming straight for me
Just let me go for now
I'll be just fine
Don't ya know now that I'm back on my own
Tell me how it feels to watch the walls of your security crumble
I remember you, you took the easy way out when I gave you something to stand for
They're coming straight for me
Just let me go for now
I'll be just fine
Don't ya know now that I'm back on my own
I was just another promise that you couldn't keep
