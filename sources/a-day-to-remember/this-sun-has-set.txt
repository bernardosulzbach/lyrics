A Day to Remember
This Sun Has Set

This sun has set on your heart
chances for redemption
and i have forgotten your name
and i thought it'd be easy
to move on completely
forgetting what was real and what was
Forget the past 
don't for once think you're better than what i have
you're the reason i never trusted anyone
Forget the past
don't for once think you're better than what i have
you're the reason i never trusted anyone
Just to forget 
wouldn't make me as happy as
it would to hate
Just to forgive is so much more
than you are worth
Think the time i spent
well so do i
and you
tore
my life apart
Single breath
you could've cared less if i was dead
if i was dead
Just to forget 
wouldn't make me as happy as
it would to hate
Just to forgive is so much more
than you are worth
worth
You care so much
about yourself
that it makes me sick to think of you
Do you think how much i lost
for you?
