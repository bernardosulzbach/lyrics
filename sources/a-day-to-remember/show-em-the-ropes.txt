A Day to Remember
Show 'Em the Ropes

Just hold your breath to make sure you won't wake up again
Cause you ruined my '04 and that's the best that I could hope for
To watch you fall apart from the inside
We're gonna spread it to the world about how you lied
A free lesson on growing up - never trust anyone to the point where your back's exposed
Every person I've ever know was a fake
And you'll see your closest ones go first
Who needs enemies?
You've got friends
I'm a gentleman and you're a liar
I'll expect the best of you but it's so hard
Let's start over
When we reach the top we'll watch you bury yourself
This wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
A free lesson on growing up make the best of their worst
And never compromise what you feel is right
I make a point to be powerful when I speak
Be the one to give them nightmares when they sleep
Never back down from anyone
I'm a gentleman and you're a liar
I'll expect the best of you but it's so hard
Let's start over
When we reach the top we'll watch you bury yourself
This wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
I watched the weight of your world cave in to crush you
