A Day to Remember
Start the Shooting

Verse 1:
Hey boys, look where we are this town ain't big enough for the both of us so get ready to run this all goes to show just how little yoyu really know about the way that we are
Bridge:
I notice everything, like every single rumor that you spread today. Your never gonna change let's set this record straight. I know all your dirty secrets that you kept from me. This conversation's over.
Chorus:
Watch your step (watch your step)
This town can chew you up and spit you out so pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Watch your step (watch your step) 
This town can chew you up and spit you out so pardon me but you shouldn't be so proud
Verse 2:
You're all the same. You think that everyone around you cares about what you think. No one knows your name. It's about that time, take everyone you know and get as far across my state line as you possibly can.
Bridge &amp; Chorus
Will they miss me when I'm gone? Will this time be for too long? Wait till then, and see if time brings change. Will they miss me when I'm gone? Will this time be for too long? Wait till then, and see if time brings change.
