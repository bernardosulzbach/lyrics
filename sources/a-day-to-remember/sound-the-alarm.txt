A Day to Remember
Sound the Alarm

I’m your alpha, and omega,
I am invincible.
I’m your alpha, and omega,
I am invincible.
I’m your alpha, and omega,
I am invincible.
I’m your alpha, and omega,
I am invincible.
I’m your alpha, and omega,
I am invincible.
I’m your alpha, and omega,
I am invincible.
(Can I just say one more thing?
I'm not gonna say,
you know,
there's plenty more fish in the sea.
I'm not going to say if you love her let her go. And I'm not going to bombard you with clichÃ©s.
But what I will say is this... 
It's not the end of the world.)
