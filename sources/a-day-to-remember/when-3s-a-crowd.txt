A Day to Remember
When 3's a Crowd

I went to sleep thinking about you
And I woke up just the same
You made it so hard for me to close my eyes
Don’t worry, babe, this will be alright in the end
And I’ll be your everything
So we’ll both tell ourselves
That this for the best
But I’m depending on you to lead me through
So try to stop those hands
You’re riding down my neck
You touch, I tremble
You never were one to play fair
These past four walls won’t be the only thing that’s keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So let’s just take this time
And we’ll use this for reflection
And I’ll see you in three days
And you’ll think of me when you’re next to him
Don’t mind my gasping
It’s just so much harder to breathe when you’re near
You made it so hard for me to learn through my eyes
Don’t mind my asking but
Could I trouble you, miss, for a smile?
Just grant me one last wish with a kiss
It’s what my dreams are made of
So we’ll both tell ourselves
That this for the best
But I’m depending on you to lead me through
So try to stop those hands
You’re riding down my neck
You touch, I tremble
You never were one to play fair
These past four walls won’t be the only thing that’s keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So let’s just take this time
And we’ll use this for reflection
And I’ll see you in three days
And you’ll think of me when you’re next to him
So here we are again
In the same situation
I’m screaming at the top of my lungs
And you’re not saying a word
Did you just mean what you said?
Why can’t you just mean what you said
When you said “No one can love you like me”?
These past four walls won’t be the only thing that’s keeping me from you
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So let’s just take this time 
And we’ll use this for reflection
And I’ll see you in three days
And you’ll think of me when you’re next to him
(We could have been beautiful)
These past four walls won’t be the only thing (We could have been beautiful)
That’s keeping me from you (We could have been beautiful)
This distance could never hold this back (I need you)
So let’s just take this time (We could have been beautiful)
And we’ll use this for reflection (We could have been beautiful)
And I’ll see you in three days
And you’ll think of me when you’re next to him
