A Day to Remember
NJ Legion Iced Tea

Get up, get out,
This is your wake up call,
We run this town and you can fight us all,
We keep on coming back for more,
And don't think you can hold us down,
We'll tear this building down,
Try to be careful what you say
Give it up, your tact is astounding,
Find your place and leave us with some peace of mind,
You do this every time
So here's to another better year,
We've crossed that thin line,
Don't try to hold us here,
If for just this once you'd think of us,
I hope you're happy with yourself,
Get up, get out,
Who's gonna break our fall,
When we don't back down, they're gonna seem so small,
We keep em running for the door,
Just when things will come back around,
It's too late for them, they're heading straight for a meltdown,
I'm not a part of your cliche,
Give it up, your tact is astounding,
Find your place and leave us with some peace of mind,
You do this every time
So here's to another better year,
We've crossed that thin line,
Don't try to hold us here,
And if for just this once you'd think of us,
I hope you're happy with yourself,
So here's to another better year,
We've crossed that thin line,
Don't try to hold us here,
And if for just this once you'd think of us,
I hope you're happy with yourself,
Just think about, just think about everything,
Be careful now, be careful what you say,
Run away
This is the life we show, this is the life I lead,
They can never take this from me
This is the life we show, this is the life I lead,
They can never take this from me
So here's to another better year,
We've crossed that thin light don't try to hold us here,
And for just this once you'd think of us,
I hope you're happy with yourself,
So here's to another better year,
We've crossed that thin light don't try to hold us here,
And for just this once you'd think of us,
I hope you're happy with yourself,
So here's to another better year,
I hope you're happy with yourself.
