A Day to Remember
If I Leave

Let's go!
In the beginning I was upfront
Nothing to think about, you'd always hear me out
We made a pact and never gave up, 
When everything would change we'd always stay the same
Something went wrong along the way, 
You come around and there's nothing left to say
Its like we're strangers anyway
What more could you ask of me
It's been a long time coming
But everyone's going to hear me out
If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave this, if I leave this way
I've always been a man of action
Never let anything keep a hold of me
Could always tell when somethings missing
Like I knew everything, except for you and me
I can't make you want to stay
Our love is not that strong
But broken in our way
I still gave it everything, 
I guess I'll never catch my break
It's been a long time coming
But everyone's going to hear me now
If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave I'll move away
And try to right all the wrongs we ever made
Won't let your problems weigh me down
If I leave this, if I leave this way
Never thought I'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are
Never thought I'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we'd come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are
If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave I'll move away
And try to right all the wrongs we ever made
Won't let your problems weigh me down
If I leave this, if I leave this way
Never thought I'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are
If I leave this, if I leave this way
