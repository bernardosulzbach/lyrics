A Day to Remember
Life Lessons Learned the Hard Way

Life lessons learned the hard way. 
4 people waited in a random white unmarked van. Parked outside your hotel high rise garage. To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs. Too bad you never came outside that's all right, cause in the end you'll get wrecked. Ya in the end you'll get wrecked.
I heard a little girl killed herself today, that bloods on your hands. It's on your hands, when everyone knows your face nothin's safe.
You'll live your life as a fucking target.
You've earned my disgust.
