A Day to Remember
All Signs Point to Lauderdale

I hate this town, it's so washed up 
And all my friends don't give a fuck 
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck 
When will I find where I fit in 
One two three four
Remember when I tried 
I never strayed to far from you 
Forever by your side 
No matter what I was going through 
But now I never know the things to say to you 
Now help me, but know I'm still on your side 
I never showed just what you do to me 
This song was always wrong 
I hate this town, it's so washed up 
And all my friends don't give a fuck 
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck 
When will I find where I fit in 
I hate this town 
'Cause no one can understand 
I just can't be tied down 
Nothing comes between me and my plans 
So now I never know the things to say to you 
Now help me prove that I'm still on your side 
I never showed just what you do to me. 
The timing was always wrong 
I hate this town, it's so washed up 
And all my friends don't give a fuck 
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck 
When will I find where I fit in 
And don't believe a word they're telling to you 
Don't believe a word they're telling to you 
They let me down, when will I find where I fit in 
I hate this town. 
My world cannot ever bring me down 
Everything I had is turning back around 
Because our time's worth something 
Bigger then both you and me 
I can't live my life always backing down 
I got to do this right, then make it make a sound 
'Cause I'm not here for nothing
At least I can say I stand for something 
You and me we stand for something. 
I hate this town, it's so washed up 
And all my friends don't give a fuck 
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck 
When will I find where I fit in 
And don't believe a word they're telling to you 
Don't believe a word they're telling to you 
They let me down, when will I find where I fit in 
I hate this town.
