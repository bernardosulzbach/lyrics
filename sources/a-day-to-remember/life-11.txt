A Day to Remember
Life @ 11

When the curtain falls it rolls, unwraps, reminds me the person that I am. I'm still afraid, ashamed, of what's behind me, but you gave me the strength to stand.
sha sha shake it off go get the things you want. I'll bottle the shame ( bottle the shame ). Just sha sha shake it off, and no one will ever know ( won't know ).
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head, and I'm afraid I'm afraid of what they've said. Im a slave. 
Sometimes when no ones left to listen ill sit and argue w myself. Say all the things I wish to tell you, without hurting someone else.
sha sha shake it off go get the things you want. I'll bottle the shame. bottle the shame. Just sha sha shake it off, and no one will ever know ( won't know ).
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head, and I'm afraid I'm afraid of what they've said. Im a slave to all these voices in my head, and I'm afraid they'll walk with me until my end.
Hey you, whend ya get so cold? Hey you, just do what you're told, do what you're told. Hey you, you're gonna be a star. As long as you'll let us we'll make you the person that you aren't.
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head, and I'm afraid I'm afraid of what they've said. Im a slave ( I'm a slave ) to all these voices in my head, and I'm afraid ( I'm afraid ) they'll walk w me until my end.
Sha sha sha shake it off go get the things you want. I'll bottle the shame ( bottle the shame ).
