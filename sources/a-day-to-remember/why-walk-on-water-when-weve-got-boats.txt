A Day to Remember
Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats

Watch what you say on the stand.
You're running in circles.
I know more than you think
And your words are empty
Of all the heavenly hosts!
This will all make sense when the records gold.
What's a few more units for your soul?
You're wasting my time,
While they're wasting away.
You'll never, you'll never save me.
You've dropped every line,
But they don't mean a thing.
You'll never, you'll never save me.
Oh!
You live your life in the saddest way I've ever seen.
You are the reason I don't believe.
I'm not denying the worth of things unseen,
And this isn't a part of the next big thing.
I'm just dying to show them all that you are
You are nothing.
