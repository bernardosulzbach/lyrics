A Day to Remember
Better Off This Way

I wonder if you'll notice, 
If they lock me up and throw away the key. 
Gotta be open minded, 
You've got a lot to learn in the ways of me. 
You've always got to say something, 
I'm none of your concern 
But you won't listen at all. 
You know I'd rather say nothing, 
And just be proud of myself, 
For tearing down these walls.
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away 
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay 
It's all over, I've found a better way,
To help keep you from me. 
I'm better off this way 
Whoa
Whoa 
I'm better off this way 
Whoa
Whoa 
You gotta keep this coming, tell me like you know it 
But you don't know nothing, your call. 
We can settle this like gentlemen, or meet me at the back 
To end it all inside again. 
My whole life's been waiting, ever since I can remember 
Been anxious awaiting your fall, and God let it be a long while 
Can't let go of my life 'till I know you're done. 
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away 
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay 
It's all over, I've found a better way 
To help keep you from me
I'm better off this way 
Whoa
Whoa 
I'm better off this way 
Whoa
Whoa 
You want it, you've got it 
You've always been such a waste of time
You want it, you've got it
A friend of yours is no friend of mine
You want it, you've got it 
When will you act your age
You want it, you've got it 
You're the reason things have to change
Whoa
Whoa 
You're the reason things have to change 
Whoa
Whoa 
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away, 
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay.
It's all over, I've found a better way 
To help keep you from me
I'm better off this way 
Whoa
Whoa 
I'm better off this way 
Whoa
Whoa 
I'm better off this way
