A Day to Remember
My Life for Hire

Somebody give a sign, that everything's going as planned
And that everything floats away, into the darkness of this shallow place
The detail is striking
The room's cold and foggy
You'll kick and you'll scream, you'll try everything to survive
But you should know your fate by now
They told me, how I should be
Too late, too late
You can't try to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
The one to remember what you've done to me
You, you know you gotta' assert yourself with what you need for now
It's not the time or place you're searching for
All I can give is my worst self-intentions
You're nothing to me, if I write what you see then your life's a lie
There's no where left to hide
They told me, how I should be
Too late, too late
You can't try to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
The one to remember what you've done to me
Too late, too late
You can't try to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
The one to remember what you've done to me
Watch your back, you'll lose yourself
This is a battleground!
When will they know!
Your life's a lie
Too late, too late
You can't try to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
The one to remember what you've done to me
Too late, too late
You can't try to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
The one to remember what you've done to me
They told me, how I should be
