A Day to Remember
Holdin' It Down for the Underground

Been through a lot this last year
Like everything I love is slipping away
And every time I come home
Somebody it isn't there
I got to get it together
I got to do things for myself
I've giving everything
Plus you take some from me
I need some room to breath
[Chorus:]
Come on come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
Come on come on
Tell me will be o.k.
(will be o.k.)
Lets go back lets go back
To a time where I
Still felt I had a family
This isn't what I remember
Everyone is looking
Out for just themselves
And need be I'd be happy to leave
?
I see straight through
That smile straight through
That painted face
Don't think I can't tell
Which one of you is against me
[Chorus]
I am the greatest thing that falls
I turn my back and look at the walls?
Pay attention!!!!
[Chorus]
Been through a lot this last year
Like everything I love is slipping away
