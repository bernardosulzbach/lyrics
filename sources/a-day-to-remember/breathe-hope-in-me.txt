A Day to Remember
Breathe Hope in Me

Im so afraid.
I cant hold on.
This time.
Thats why I write,
To let you know,
Just what goes on.
Cause this is me
And everything I've dreamed.
And you know that I cant just settle
For anything.
Just once more.
Can we pretend that everything is ok?
And that we are all happy.
Breathe Hope In Me.
I need you.
I try so hard to make this work in my life.
I still believe in you.
Play that faster and maybe they will move to our sound.
This is the way its supposed to be.
Coming together, on the dance floor will 
You light the scene. 
Sing along.
This is your favorite song.
We'll play along. Cause you're the reason I'm alive.
Close your eyes
Sit back and relax, we'll be ok.
Time and time again, I'll pray you're looking back.
By the wake.
So here we, we are, again. (x4)
Close your eyes
Sit back and relax, we'll be ok.
Time and time again, I do hope you come back.
By the wake.
Close your eyes
Sit back and relax, we'll be ok.
Time and time again, I'll pray you're looking back.
By the wake.
By the wake.
A wake.
By the wake.
