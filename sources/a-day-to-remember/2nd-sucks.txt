A Day to Remember
2nd Sucks

Fight!
You're afraid,
Like I make my deals with the devil.
You've been at it for years
But couldn't reach that next level.
Let's keep it real,
This is no competition to me.
Even if everyone around you acts
Like they don't see.
(Oh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind
Is what you'll always be.
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest.
I laid my life on the line
So I expect nothing less from you.
I speak the truth,
And everybody else knows it.
So set your ego to the side
And just get the fuck over it.
Can't waist my time
On hateful people like you.
So keep wishing you were me,
And I'll keep making you have to.
(Oh!) Was anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind
Is what you'll always be.
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest.
I laid my life on the line
So I expect nothing less from you.
I just cant believe
Its really come to this
Because without me
You would not exist.
Hey hey
Still got somethin' left to say.
Only one in the world
I depend on is me.
I need nothin' from no one
I take what I need.
Get a hold of yourself
And keep away from me.
(Oh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind
Is what you'll always be.
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest.
I laid my life on the line
So I expect nothing less from you.
