A Day to Remember
I'm Already Gone

As I look round, this make shift moving house,
I'm searching for whatever's left of me. 
It's on the ground in a box that reads lost and found
It's lost and found.
She said, "Just let it go."
She said, "It's all you've ever known."
And I'm- I'm already gone. 
I'm already somethin' to someone that I don't know. 
(When will I know?) 
And I'm - I'm out makin' rounds on every side of town, 
That I've been through; that I know.
To find my reason to come back home.
I've worked it out, you'll always bring me down.
From here on out I'm doing things for me.
Impatient now;
I'm not the type for life alone, I need someone.
She said, "Just let it go." 
She said, "It's all you've ever known."
And I'm- I'm already gone. 
I'm already somethin to someone that I don't know. 
(When will I know?)
And I'm - I'm out makin' rounds on every side of town
That I've been through; that I know. 
To find my reason to come back home.
With everything that sets me back
I push back harder to clear the way.
There's not a thing that I regret, 
Can't live my life in yesterday. 
(Life in yesterday)
And I'm - I'm already gone 
I'm already somethin' to someone that I don't know. 
(When will I know?)
I'm out makin' rounds on every side of town 
That I've been through; that I know. 
To find my reason to come back home.
