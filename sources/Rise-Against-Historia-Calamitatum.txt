Rise Against
Historia Calamitatum

Even though we know, yeah we know
Our time has almost come, we're all overdue
Can there be a place to call our own?
Can there be a road that takes us home?
We toe the line
We go along
We toe the line
To you now
When it rains it pours
Like summer storms
The skies as gray as leaves
The rivers flood the banks
And spill into the streets
But the people laughed
And swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave
Way as if to agree
When it rains it pours
The mystery unknown
Now unfolds
The life that we once owned
First bought, then sold
Like messengers of war
We've no control
To oceans unexplored
This ship sails through
We toe the line
We go along
We toe the line
To you now
When it rains it pours
Like summer storms
The skies as gray as leafs
The rivers flood the banks
And spill into the streets
But the people laughed
And swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave
Way as if to agree
When it rains it pours, it pours, it pours
When it rains it pours
When they die, we mourn
When it hit, we swore
Now we want not more
Like a saint reborn
Like a rose in a storm
Like a child unborn
A child unborn
It's the coin
We're tossing into the well
It's misfortune that
We could not foretell
It's the dry spell
When it rains it pours
Like summer storms
The skies as gray as leafs
The rivers flood the banks
And spill into the streets
But the people laughed
And swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave
Way as if to agree
When it rains it pours, it pours
When it rains it pours
