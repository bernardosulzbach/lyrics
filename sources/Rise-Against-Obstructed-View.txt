Rise Against
Obstructed View

To all you people standing proud, thinking you know what I'm about, I think you can fuck yourself
(Let's go!)
From your safe distance in this crowd
That's when your voice becomes so loud
Still trying to keep us down
Walk one mile in shoes I never asked to fill 
But still I press on?.
I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything
My hope, my faith, in what the future brings
In hopes of pushing past the tie that brings us down 
We sing together now.
Give me one reason to look you in the eye
(Just one!)
Tell me exactly why it is that you think you are worth my time
I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything.
My hope, my faith, in what the future brings
In hopes of pushing past the tie that brings us down 
We sing together now.
To all the ones that shake my hand
Then talk your shit behind my back
To those who claim they understand
But never heard a word I said
In spite of you, I am still here
This vision has never been more clear
As we sing together now.
(Now that's when!)
I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything
My hope, my faith, in what the future brings
In hopes of pushing past the tie that brings us down 
We sing together now.
