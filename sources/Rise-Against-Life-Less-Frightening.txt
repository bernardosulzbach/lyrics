Rise Against
Life Less Frightening

Suffering from something we're not sure of
In a world there is no cure for
These lives we live test negative for happiness
Flat line, no pulse, but eyes open
Single file like soldiers on a mission
If there's no war outside our heads
Why are we losing?
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening, a life less frightening
Hang me out to dry I'm soaking
With the sense of knowing
What's gone wrong but doing nothing I still run
Time again I have found myself stuttering
Foundations pulled out from under me
This breath is wasted on them all
Will someone answer me
[Chorus]
Is there a God tonight?
Up in the sky or is it empty just like me (Just like me)
A place where we can hide out from the night
Where you are all I need (Where you are all I need)
So all he says, goodbye, and close your eyes
Tell me what you say (Tell me what you say)
A life I sit inside this dream of mine 
Where you are all I see
[Chorus]
