Rise Against
Fix Me (Black Flag cover)

Someday I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
They'll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please,
I don't wanna be dead
Someday we'll all be rich
Someday I won't listen to you bitch
I'll turn up the volume and you
Can hear all the shit we play just for you
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please,
I don't wanna be dead
Someday I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
They'll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please,
I don't wanna be dead
Fix it!
