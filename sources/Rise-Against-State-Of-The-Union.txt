Rise Against
State Of The Union

If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea
[Chorus]
Countdown, to the very end, 
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now, 
In time you firmly secure your place in hell 
State of the union address, 
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue
[Chorus]
'Guilty' is what our graves will read, 
No years, no family, 
We did nothing to stop the murder of a people just like us
