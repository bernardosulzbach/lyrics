Rise Against
To Them These Streets Belong

So look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious)
You got what you came for now I think its time to move on (when will you say)
But these ghosts come alive like water and wine 
Walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs, 
To them these streets belong
My atonement lasts the best part of eternity(eternity)
Ran out of hands to count the sin that breeds inside of me (inside of me)
Not this hate but the loneliness has left me here into this mess of
My hands are soaking in the blood of angels
On broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day)
Dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
All these lost halos wash away 
Head hung from shame we bear a weight that brings me to a crawl (to a crawl)
These years of lounging tell of decades of unanswered calls (unanswered calls)
For a change, 'cause everyday we slip and fall
Kicked while were down, our fists clenched into a ball
My hands are soaking in the blood of angels 
On broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day)
Dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
All these lost halos wash away
So look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious)
You got what you came for now I think its time to move on (when will you say)
But these ghosts come alive like water and wine
Walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs 
To them these streets belong
