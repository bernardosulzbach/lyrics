The Mountain Goats
Unmasked!

Rain beats down, down on the outer walls
Down on the skylight, where the streetlights shine
Like unquenchable coals
And I’m up high, trying to say goodbye
The only way I know how
Crude and graceless
Peeking through the eyeholes
Seeing the real you
And just after midnight
When it feels like it’s getting late
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
Crowd’s half-gone, just a few hangers-on
Come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last
And you don’t care, you look almost relieved down there
Like you’re free, like you can breathe now
Like they’ve sawn off your cast
One more sleeper to see through
And by way of honoring
The things we once both held dear
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
Cast of thousands we were the real two
And when I’m alone before a mirror late at night
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
