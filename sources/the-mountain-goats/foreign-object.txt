The Mountain Goats
Foreign Object

Whipped like a dog down on the cards
Square in the spotlight sweating real hard
All soaked in blood like a newborn babe
Sharp thing hidden in my hand shaped like an astrolabe
Gonna stick you in the eye with a foreign object
Gonna poke you in the eye with a foreign object
March through the red mist never get my vision clear 
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere
Strike funny poses keep my weapon hand low
Whip my head around a little get blood on the front row
Gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
Gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object
Foreign object
Foreign object
Foreign object
Sink my teeth into your scalp take a nice big bite
Save nothing for the cameras play the angles all night
One of these days my legs’ll both snap like twigs
If you can’t beat ’em make ’em bleed like pigs
Gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I'm Gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object
Foreign object
Foreign object
Foreign object
