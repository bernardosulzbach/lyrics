Bring Me the Horizon
Hospital For Souls

And then I found out how hard it is to really change, 
Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in. 
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave. 
No matter how fucked you get, 
The sun will return and you come back down! 
The funny thing is all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends that I have, the music I made, 
The love that I feel, I just had to start again
The days are a death wish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Idle in the halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
I can fear death no longer
I've died a thousand times
A wasteful universe
And we don't know our soul was
Emptiness inside our heads
But no one dares to dwell
Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn
How are we on a scale of one to ten?
You can tell me, what do you say?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists
Have you've been skipping meals
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, tell me go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, tell me go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls
