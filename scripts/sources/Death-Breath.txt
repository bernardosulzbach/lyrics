Bring Me the Horizon
Death Breath

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
