Bring Me the Horizon
Crooked Young

Believe in the one
Hallelujah, well I'm saved
Just a dozen steps and 28 days
It's a miracle, I'll be born again
As the Lord as my Shepard
I will find a way
Fuck your faith, no ones gonna save you
Fuck your faith
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young
The crooked young
We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No death can touch the crooked young
Believe in the one
Fuck yourself
The faceless won't save you
The clouds will eat your fucking prayers
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch
Hallelujah
I say it's a miracle, thank you Jesus
Hallelujah, I say
Fuck your faith, fuck your faith
