Bring Me the Horizon
Crucify Me

Crucify me, nail my hands to a wooden cross.
There is nothing above, there is nothing below.
Heaven and Hell lives in all of us,
And I've been cast astray.
I am an ocean, I am the sea,
There is a world inside of me.
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep,
No set of rules could salvage me.
Only a shipwreck, only a ghost,
Merely a graveyard of your former self.
We just watched the waves crash over.
I've been cast astray.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
(No one needs to know)

Save yourself, save your breath,
The tides too strong, you'll catch your death.
So breathe for me, just breathe.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.
If we make it through the night, if I make it out alive,
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead.
And you say that you can save me,
Don't hope to ever find me,
I fear I'm too far gone.
Pray for the dead

Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention?
There is something you all really need to know.
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it.
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret.

I am the ocean, I am the sea
