Bring Me the Horizon
Eyeless (Slipknot cover)

Yeah
Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill everything and everyone?
Say you'll do it but never will
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
I am my father's son
He's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you've gotta do is get rid of me
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
Yeah
I tried, you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and you gave me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit, it's shit that you gave me
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
Yeah
Oh
Do you wanna feel pain? Taking my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse the ride
Who the fuck are you? Fuck you
Better suck it up 'cause you bleed through
You better stay away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I feel safe, seems you're saved
I feel safe, seems you're saved
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Mother fucker
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new
