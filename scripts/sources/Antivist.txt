Bring Me the Horizon
Antivist

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything
The world's in the shit and your children are fucked
The ones you think got you are out for your blood
Well, the lines are blurred and washed out with spite
So what exactly do you think you're going to change?
United we'll fail
Divided we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're making it worse.
United we'll fail
Divided we'll fall
Give up, 'cause you're making it so much worse
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything
Give me a break, you deluded arrogant fuck
Self-savvy prick
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your seat and onto the street
There will be no peaceful revolution,
No war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool who stands for nothing
Well for that, I say you're a cunt
Kick it
United we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
United, we'll fail
We're fucked, but you're making it worse
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything
