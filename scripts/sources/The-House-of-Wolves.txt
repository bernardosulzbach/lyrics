Bring Me the Horizon
The House of Wolves

Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your god damn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll fear
Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand times
Show me your face, show me a reason to think,
My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand times
(The wolves you built) (the wolves you built) 
(The nest of wolves you built) 
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep
Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand times
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns
You said you want me
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
You said you want me
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
