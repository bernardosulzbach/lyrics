Bring Me the Horizon
Alligator Blood

Let's play a game of Russian roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive
Tell me who will make it out alive
Over and over and over again
We play the same old game
Cards kept close to our chest, that's where your secrets kept
So wear your poker face, hands to the fool, hands to the thief
Fiction is bitter and you got a taste
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
Cut me up and wear my skin
Show me how to live
Tear me down, clean me up
Now spill my fucking guts
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
Or put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know you can go, you can give up trying
Should of just called it quits,
Should of just called it quits,
Leave before it's too late
Leave before it's too late
Let's play a game of Russian roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bet
Tell me who will make it out alive
Tell me who will make it out alive
Yeah
(So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my fucking brain)
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the fucking walls
