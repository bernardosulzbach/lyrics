Bring Me the Horizon
Blasphemy

You got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy
But the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say, your faith that you ignored
So don't try to tell me that you still believe
No don't preach to me
Ask no questions and you'll get no lies
Turn the cheek and blind the eye
Let it go
Bend the knee and give away your life
Bite your tongue and close your mind
Never know
'Cause you got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy
But the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say, your faith that you ignored
So don't try to tell me that you still believe
No don't preach to me
You're not blessed you're cursed
And it's getting worse now
It makes no sense but it must right
The blood and sweat you sacrificed
Was it all for nothing
'Cause you found no sign and see no light
We hear no voice when we pray at night
But we swore and now it's too late to turn back
You're not blessed you're cursed
And it's getting worse now
You got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy
But the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say, your faith that you ignored
So don't try to tell me that you still believe
No don't preach to me
No don't preach to me
Don't preach to me
No don't preach to me
It's blasphemy
