Bring Me the Horizon
(I Used to Make Out with) Medusa

Dead hands clutch my arm,
The smell of death fills the air,
Her fragrance, her carcass reanimates,
If you need me I'll be tying a rope to the tree,
Where our, where our love used to be,
I've took down every photo of us, and buried them at sea,
I've took down every photo, and I buried them at sea,
Don't worry sweetie, 
Beauty is only skin deep,
Psyche!
Your beauty is no more,
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore?
Oh, your beauty is no, no more,
So why don't you just fuck yourself you stupid fucking whore?
"I should have know, not to look into her eyes,
I'm cast to stone, her glare was my demise."
Medusa,
Medusa,
Oh, your beauty is no, no more,
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore?
Dead hands clutch my arm,
The smell of death, it fills the air,
Her fragrance, her carcass reanimates,
Since you left me, (I've never)
Since you left me, (been the same)
Since you left me, (I've never)
Since you left me, (been the fucking same)
Go,
Hour by hour, day by day,
Your memory will fade away, 
Every sunrise, every sunset, 
Will help me to forget,
Your name, your smile, 
Your eyes - Medusa,
Decapitate her and bring her head to Athena,
Unlike her sisters, she ain't no deathless God,
This is for every time you stabbed me in the back,
For every notch in your bed post,
This is for every time you stabbed me in the back,
For every notch in your bed post,
Bed post,
