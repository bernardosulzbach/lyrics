Bring Me the Horizon
Doomed

CCut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires so here
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
The walls are a funeral, I run with ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
Then kick the chair but we, we help tie the rope
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
You must of made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead I'm awake
The devil told me no room for cheats
I thought I sold my soul, but he kept the receipt
So leave the lights on Iâ€™m coming home
It's getting darker but I carry on
The sun won't shine here, it never did
And when it rains, it fucking pours
But I think I like it
And you know that I'm love with the pain
I think I like it
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come show me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
