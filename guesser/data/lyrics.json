        "So take a deep breath, let's disappear",
        "No one will miss us so why are we still here?",
        "And in the black hole you will see it all",
        "Cause this is not enough",
        "And I won't wait for them to cut me up",

        "So let's run",
        "So let's run",
        "Your head's a hurricane; it moves in waves",
        "A perfect storm that keeps you wide awake",
        "But through the silence, you will feel it burn",
        "So take my hand and let's fade away",
        "You know there's nothing here to make us stay",
